<h1 title="">THE RIVAL CAMPERS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP</span></h2>
<p>On a certain afternoon in the latter part of
the month of June, the little fishing village
of Southport, on Grand Island in Samoset
Bay, was awakened from its customary nap by the
familiar whistle of the steamboat from up the river.
Southport, opening a sleepy eye at the sound, made
deliberate preparation to receive its daily visitor,
knowing that the steamer was as yet some distance
up the island, and not even in sight, for behind the
bluff around which the steamer must eventually come
the town lay straggling irregularly along the shore
of a deeply indented cove.</p>
<p>A few loungers about the village grocery-store
seemed roused to a renewed interest in life, removed
their pipes, and, with evident satisfaction at this relief
from island monotony, sauntered lazily down to the
wharf. The storekeeper and the freight-agent, as
became men burdened with the present responsibility
of seeing that the steamer was offered all possible
assistance in making its landing, bustled about with
importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>Soon a wagon or two from down the island came
rattling into the village, while from the hotel, a quarter
of a mile distant, a number of guests appeared on
the veranda, curious to scrutinize such new arrivals
as might appear. From the summer cottages here
and there flags were hastily run up, and from one a
salute was fired; all of which might be taken to indicate
that the coming of the steamer was the event
of the day at Southport&mdash;as, indeed, it was.</p>
<p>Now another whistle sounded shrilly from just behind
the bluff, and the next moment the little steamer
shoved its bow from out a jagged screen of rock,
while the chorused exclamation, &ldquo;Thar she is!&rdquo; from
the assembled villagers announced that they were fully
awake to the situation.</p>
<p>Among the crowd gathered on the wharf, three
boys, between whom there existed sufficient family
resemblance to indicate that they were brothers,
scanned eagerly the faces of the passengers as the
steamer came slowly to the landing. The eldest of
the three, a boy of about sixteen years, turned at
length to the other two, and remarked, in a tone of
disappointment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not aboard. I can&rsquo;t see a sign of them.
Something must have kept them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said one of the others, &ldquo;they are hiding
somewhere to surprise us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said the first boy, &ldquo;for any one
to hide away when he gets in sight of this island.
No, if they were aboard we should have seen them
the minute the steamer turned the bluff, waving to us
and yelling at the top of their lungs. There&rsquo;s something
in the air here that makes one feel like tearing
around and making a noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially at night, when the cottagers are asleep,&rdquo;
said the third boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued the eldest, &ldquo;their canoe is not
aboard, and you would not catch Tom Harris and
Bob White coming down here for the summer without
it, when they spend half their time in it on the
river at home and are as expert at handling it as
Indians,&mdash;and yet, they wrote that they would be
here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident the boys they were looking for were
not aboard. The little steamer, after a violent demonstration
of puffing and snorting, during which it made
apparently several desperate attempts to rush headlong
on the rocks, but was checked with a hasty scrambling
of paddle-wheels, and was bawled at by captain and
mates, was finally subdued and made fast to the wharf
by the deck-hands. The passengers disembarked, and
the same lusty, brown-armed crew, with a series of
rushes, as though they feared their captive might at
any moment break its bonds and make a dash for
liberty, proceeded to unload the freight and baggage.
Trucks laden with leaning towers of baggage were
trundled noisily ashore and overturned upon the wharf.</p>
<p>In the midst of the bustle and commotion the group
of three boys was joined by another boy, who had
just come from the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, there!&rdquo; said the new boy. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Tom and Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are not aboard, Henry,&rdquo; said the eldest
boy of the group.</p>
<p>The new arrival gave a whistle of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel this afternoon, Henry?&rdquo; asked
the second of the brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very poorly&mdash;very miserable. In fact, I
don&rsquo;t seem to get any better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lugubrious reply, strange to say, did not evoke
the sympathy which a listener might have expected.
The boys burst into roars of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Henry Burns!&rdquo; exclaimed the eldest boy,
giving the self-declared invalid a blow on the chest
that would have meant the annihilation of weak lungs.
&ldquo;He will never be any better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he may be a great deal worse,&rdquo; said the
second boy, slapping the other on the back so hard
that the dust flew under the blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the boys like him, though?&rdquo; asked the
third and youngest boy,&mdash;&ldquo;that is, if they ever
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns received these sallies with the utmost
unconcern. If he enjoyed the effect which his remarks
had produced, it was denoted only by a twinkle in his
eyes. He was rather a slender, pale-complexioned
youth, of fourteen years. A physiognomist might have
found in his features an unusual degree of coolness
and self-control, united with an abnormal fondness for
mischief; but Henry Burns would have passed with
the ordinary person as a frail boy, fonder of books
than of sports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Just then the captain of the steamer put his head out
of the pilot-house and called to the eldest of the
brothers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a note for you, George Warren. A young
chap who said he was on his way here in a canoe
came aboard at Millville and asked me to give it to
you; and there was another young chap in a canoe
alongside who asked me to say they&rsquo;d be here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried George Warren, opening and
reading the note. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the boys, sure enough. They
started at four o&rsquo;clock this morning in the canoe, and
will be here to-night. Much obliged, Captain Chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; responded the captain. &ldquo;But let me
tell you boys something. You needn&rsquo;t look for these
&rsquo;ere young chaps to-night, because they won&rsquo;t get
here. What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; added the captain, as he surveyed
the water and sky with the air of one defying
the elements to withhold a secret from him, &ldquo;if they
try to cross the bay to-night you needn&rsquo;t look for them
at all. The bay is nothing too smooth now; but wait
till the tide turns and the wind in those clouds off
to the east is let loose! There&rsquo;s going to be fun
out there, and that before many hours, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this dismally prophetic remark the captain
gave orders to cast off the lines, and the steamer was
soon on its way down the bay.</p>
<p>The three brothers, George, Arthur, and Joe Warren,
and Henry Burns left the wharf and were walking
in the direction of the hotel, when a remark from
the latter stopped them short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did it occur to any of you,&rdquo; asked Henry Burns,
speaking in a slightly drawling tone, &ldquo;that we shall
never have a better opportunity to play a practical
joke on your friends than we have to-day&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What friends?&rdquo; exclaimed George Warren, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said Tom Harris and Bob White
were coming down the river to-day in a canoe,&rdquo; said
Henry Burns, in the most innocent manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so they are. And you think we would play
a joke on them the first day they arrive, do you?
I believe you would get up in the night, Henry Burns,
to play a joke on your own grandmother. No, sirree,
count me out of that,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;It
will be time enough to play jokes on them after they
get here. I don&rsquo;t believe in treating friends in that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a mean thing to do, I think,&rdquo; said Arthur
Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of it,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t occur to any of you to ask what the
joke is, does it?&rdquo; asked Henry Burns, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to know,&rdquo; replied George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, either,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it to play on Witham,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll enlighten you without your asking,&rdquo; continued
Henry Burns, nothing abashed. &ldquo;You did not
notice, perhaps, that though your friends, Tom and
Bob, did not come ashore to-day, their baggage did,
and it is back there on the wharf. Now I propose that
we get John Briggs to let us take his wheelbarrow,
wheel their traps over to the point, pitch their tent
for them, and have everything ready by the time they
get here. It&rsquo;s rather a mean thing to do, I know,
and not the kind of a trick I&rsquo;d play on old Witham;
but there&rsquo;s nothing particular on hand in that line
for to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Henry Burns paused, with a sly twinkle in his eyes,
to note the effect of his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; roared George Warren, slapping Henry
Burns again on the back, regardless of the delicate
state of that young gentleman&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;We might
have known better than to take Henry Burns seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old Henry Burns,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Take
notice, boys, that he never is beaten in anything he
sets his heart on, and that his delicate health will
never, never be any better;&rdquo; and he was about to
imitate his elder brother&rsquo;s example in the matter of
a punch at Henry Burns, but the latter, though of
slighter build, grappled with him, and after a moment&rsquo;s
friendly wrestling laid him on his back on the greensward,
thereby illustrating the force of his remark as
to Henry Burns&rsquo;s invincibility.</p>
<p>The suggestion was at once followed. Within an
hour the boys had wheeled the baggage of the campers
to a point of land overlooking the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all here,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, finally, as two
of the boys deposited a big canvas bag, containing the
tent, upon the grass, &ldquo;except that one box on the
wharf, which looks as though it contained food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can let that stay there till we get things shipshape
here, or get Briggs to put it in the storehouse
by and by,&rdquo; suggested young Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>But if they could have foreseen then that the leaving
of the box there upon the wharf, seemingly such
an inconsequential thing, was to be the means of
creating no end of trouble, it is quite possible that
even young Joe himself, though rather fond of his
ease, would have brought it away on his own shoulders;
but it seemed of no consequence whether it
should be removed then or later, and so the box
remained where it was.</p>
<p>It required but a brief time to pitch the tent. It
was a large, square-shaped canvas, with high walls
on two sides, so that a person of medium height could
stand erect there, and running to a peak at the top
in the usual &ldquo;A&rdquo; shape. Putting the frame, of two
poles and a cross-piece, together, and drawing the
canvas over it as it lay on the ground, the two larger
boys raised it into position while the others drove the
pegs and stretched the guy-ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; drawled Henry Burns, &ldquo;if you care
to, we can carry the joke still further by cutting some
poles and putting up the bunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposition also meeting with approval, Henry
Burns and the eldest of the Warrens started for the
woods, about a mile distant, to cut some spruce poles,
leaving the younger brothers to complete the pegging
of the tent, ditching it, and getting things in order.</p>
<p>The spot which had been selected for the camping-ground
was one of the most beautiful on the island.
It was a small point of land projecting into the bay,
with a sandy beach on either side. Its outermost
extremity, however, ended in a wall of ledge, which
went down abruptly, so that the water at high tide
came up to within a few feet of the greensward, and
at low tide dropped down, rather than receded, leaving
no bare rocks exposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>A few spruce-trees grew on the point, sufficient to
give shade, and in the midst of a clump of them was
a clear spring of water that was cool to iciness during
the hottest days. The point commanded a view of
the entire bay on the eastern side of the island, so
that when the breeze came up from the south, as it
did almost daily through the summer, blowing fresh
and steadily, the billows over all its broad surface
seemed to be aiming their blows directly at it, while
every breath of wind was laden with a salt odour that
was health-giving and inspiring.</p>
<p>It was a choice bit of land that Bob&rsquo;s uncle had
purchased several years ago, when a few speculators
had thought the island might be &ldquo;boomed&rdquo; as a
summer resort. The little fishing village of Southport,
which numbered then some twenty odd houses,
had, indeed, been augmented by the &ldquo;boom&rdquo; by about
the same number of cottages; and adjoining the old
tavern there had been built a more imposing structure,
the new and the old composing the summer hotel.</p>
<p>But the village had not &ldquo;boomed.&rdquo; It remained the
same peaceful, quiet, quaint, and interesting village
as of yore. Those cottagers who remained after the
boom died out were rather glad than otherwise that
the picturesque place had not been transformed into a
fashionable resort. They liked it for its tranquillity
and quaintness, and soon came into sympathy and
friendliness with the villagers, who had parted with
their lands only with the greatest reluctance, and who
viewed the new order of things with a suspicion born
of years of conservativeness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>The gaiety of the place centred about the hotel,
where, too, the greater number of the guests were
those who came year after year, and who would as
soon have thought of going to Jericho as to any other
place than the island.</p>
<p>The leading citizen of the village was Squire James
Brackett, and its moving spirit one Captain Curtis,
or &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Sam,&rdquo; as he was familiarly known. The
former owned the best house in the village, a big,
rambling, two-story farmhouse, perched on the hill
overlooking the harbour. He was a vessel-owner and
a man of importance. He was the only man in the
town who had persistently refused to associate with
the summer residents, which some attributed to the
fact that he feared lest their coming might disturb his
sway over town affairs.</p>
<p>Captain Sam was a man of altogether different
stamp. It is safe to say he was on good terms with
everybody on the island. He was for ever busy; the
first man to arise in the town, and the last to retire
at night. In fact, it is a fair assumption that, had
Captain Sam deserted the island at an early date in
its history, the town might have eventually fallen so
sound asleep that it would not have awakened to this
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Captain Sam united in his activities the duties of
storekeeper, coal and ice merchant, musician, constable,
and schoolmaster, the latter vocation occupying
his winter months. The energy of the village was
concentrated in this one man, who seemed tireless.
He was on intimate terms with everybody, and knew
everybody&rsquo;s business. That he was rather good-looking
was the cause of some pangs of jealousy on the
part of young Mrs. Curtis, when business called her
husband away among the housewives and maids of
the village. Finally, Captain Sam had a voice which
defied walls and distance. It was even told by some
of the village humourists that he had once stood at
the head of the island and hailed a vessel sailing
around the extreme southern end, thirteen miles distant.</p>
<p>Grand Island, lying in the middle of the bay, almost
divides the upper part of it into two big bodies of
water, so that there are two great thoroughfares for
vessels, leading out to sea, the western being the more
generally used, for it is a more direct passage. The
eastern bay is filled with islands at the entrance to the
sea.</p>
<p>In the course of an hour, the boys who had gone
to the woods returned to the camp, bringing with them
four spruce poles. These were quickly trimmed of
their branches, and cut to an even length of about
seven feet. Then, four stakes being driven into the
ground on each side of the tent under the walls, to
form the legs of the bunks, the poles were mounted on
these and made fast. Then pieces of board were nailed
across from pole to pole, and on these were placed
mattresses stuffed with dry hay from Captain Sam&rsquo;s
stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said young Joe, throwing himself on one
of them, &ldquo;is a spring bed that can&rsquo;t be beaten anywhere.
I know some think spruce boughs are better,
but they dry, and the needles fall off, and the bed
gets hard. These will last all summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The pliant spruce poles were as good, indeed, as
springs.</p>
<p>In the meantime the younger boys had dug a trench
completely around the tent, extending to the edge
of the bank on one side of the point, so that a heavy
rain could not flood the floor. In the rear of the
tent they had set a huge box belonging to the campers,
made of a packing-case and provided with a cover
that lifted on leather hinges, and a padlock. It was,
presumably, filled with the camp outfit. In one corner
of the tent, on a box, they placed a large oil-stove and
oven. The bedding was taken inside, and everything
made shipshape. The comfort of the prospective
campers seemed assured.</p>
<p>Over the top of the tent they had also stretched a
big piece of stout cloth, made for the purpose, which
was fastened to the ground at the ends with guy-ropes
and pegs, and which was to protect the tent against
leaking water in any long rainy period, and also serve
as additional shade in hot weather.</p>
<p>The boys had done a hard afternoon&rsquo;s work. Pinning
back the flaps of the tent, they sat at the entrance
and looked out across the bay. The wind, which blew
from the southeast, had not grown idle during the
afternoon, but had increased steadily, and now came
strong and damp from off the bay, rushing in at the
opening of the tent and bulging it out so that it tugged
violently at the ropes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to leave the tent-door unpinned,&rdquo; said
Henry Burns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to blow great guns to-night.&rdquo;
So, closing the entrance and making it fast,
they went to the edge of the bank and sat there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rough out there now,&rdquo; said George Warren,
pointing to the bay, which was one mass of foaming
waves; &ldquo;but it will be worse from now till midnight.
The wind is going to blow harder and the tide is
just beginning to run out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tide indeed set strongly down the island shore,
so that when it met the wind and waves blown up
from oceanward it made a rough and turbulent chop
sea.</p>
<p>All at once as they sat there a sailboat rushed out
from behind the headland across the cove and thrashed
its way through the white-capped waves, heading
down the island and throwing the spray at every
plunge into the seas. Those aboard had evidently a
reckless disregard for their own safety, for, although
such few coasters as could be seen in the distance were
scudding for harbour, fearful of the approaching
storm, this craft carried not only full mainsail and
forestaysail,&mdash;sail, too, that was large for the boat
at all times,&mdash;but a topsail and a jib. The boat
was hauled well into the wind and heeled over, so
that the water again and again came over the board
into the cockpit.</p>
<p>Perched upon the windward rail were three boys.
A fourth, a boy evidently near George Warren&rsquo;s age,
stood at the wheel, seemingly the most unconcerned
of all. He was large of his age and powerfully built,
and his sleeves, rolled above the elbow, showed two
brown and brawny arms. A fifth boy, somewhat
younger in appearance, lying in the bottom of the
boat, with feet braced against the side, held the main-sheet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>The boat was a white sloop, about thirty feet in
length over all, and clearly fast and able.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say one thing for Jack Harvey and his crew,&rdquo;
exclaimed George Warren, as the yacht rushed by the
point, &ldquo;although I think they&rsquo;re a mean lot. They can
handle a boat as well as any skipper on the island.
And as for fear, they don&rsquo;t know what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you see what they are
doing?&rdquo; as the yacht was suddenly brought, quivering,
into the wind and headed away from the island
on the other tack. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in the world
Jack Harvey&rsquo;s doing that for except to frighten the
hotel guests. He sees the crowd on the piazza watching
him, and is just making game of their fright.
He&rsquo;ll sail out there as long as he dares, or until his
topmast goes, just to keep them watching him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so indeed it proved. An anxious crowd of
summer guests at the hotel had no sooner begun to
rejoice at the boat&rsquo;s apparent safety, than they saw it
go about and head out into the bay once more. Then
they breathed easier as it headed about again, and came
rushing in. Then as it once more headed for the bay,
they realized that what they were witnessing was a
sheer bit of folly and recklessness. Angry as they
were, they could but stand there and watch the yacht
man&oelig;uvre, the women crying out whenever a flaw
threw the yacht over so that the mainsail was wet
by the waves; the men angry at the bravado of the
youthful yachtsmen, and vowing that the yacht might
sink and the crew go with it before they would lift
a hand to save one of them. All of which they knew
they did not mean,&mdash;a fact which only increased their
irritation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said George Warren, as a big drop of rain
suddenly splashed on his cheek. &ldquo;Perhaps this will
drive them in, if the wind won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; It had, indeed,
begun to rain hard, and, although the crew of the
yacht must have been drenched through and through
with the flying spray, the water from the sky had,
evidently, a more dampening effect on their spirits,
for the yacht was headed inshore, and soon ran into a
cove about three-quarters of a mile down the island,
behind a point of land where, through the trees, the
indistinct outlines of a tent could be seen.</p>
<p>And so, as it was now the time when the sun would
have set upon the bay, if it had not been shut out
from sight by a heavy mass of clouds, and as the
wind came laden with rain, which dashed in the faces
of those who were out-of-doors to encounter it, the
boys turned from the spot where they had gathered
and hurried for shelter, the brothers to their cottage,
and Henry Burns to the hotel.</p>
<p>The tent, swayed by the fierce gusts of wind, tugged
at its ropes; the reckless crew of the white sloop had
found shelter, and those vessels that were out upon
the bay eagerly sought the same.</p>
<p>But in that part of the bay which rolled between
the northern end of the island and the mouth of the
river, fifteen miles away, a greater piece of recklessness
was being enacted than was ever dared by Harvey
and his careless crew. There was none on shore there
to witness it, for the island at that extreme end was
bare of settlement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>A mile from the nearest land, seemingly at the
mercy of a wild sea which threatened every moment
to engulf it, a small canoe slowly and stubbornly
fought its way toward the island shore. At a distance
one would have thought it a mere log, tossed
about at random by the waves; and yet, one watching
it would have seen it slowly draw ahead, glide
from under the spray that broke constantly over its
bow, and still make progress; sometimes beaten back
by billows that tumbled fast one upon another, but
gaining something through it all.</p>
<p>There were two occupants of the craft, and, though
but mere youths, none could have handled the paddles
more skilfully. Yet it was a question of the great
sea&rsquo;s strength against their endurance. What would
happen should they find that there came a time when
they made no gain? If they turned about, even supposing
that were possible, the storm might drive them
across the bay once more, but their strength and
courage would be gone, and they could hardly hope
to reach the shore. It was either the island goal or
nothing.</p>
<p>One standing on the shore would scarce have seen
them now. Darkness began to hide them. But the
island loomed up, dim and shadowy, before them, and
they struggled on against the storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>A person leaving the wharf at Southport
would ordinarily take one of three roads: the
one directly ahead leading up through the village
and past the hotel; the one to the left passing
by, though at some distance from, the cottages that
were scattered irregularly along the south shore of
the bay; the road to the right leading similarly to
the cottages on that shore. The shore there, however,
made a deep sweep, bordering on a cove of some considerable
extent.</p>
<p>From the shore in all directions the land sloped
back, with a gradual rise for about a mile. Cottages
dotted the slope here and there.</p>
<p>To the right of the wharf and the farthest away
from it of any dwelling was the Warren cottage.
Somewhat hidden in a grove of spruce-trees, its broad
piazza commanded a fine view of the bay and the
islands in the distance.</p>
<p>On this particular evening, however, there was little
inducement of wind or weather for one to linger there.
The rain, driven by the wind through fluttering tree-branches,
dashed itself against the cottage windows
as though the drops were drawn, like moths, to the
light which shone from within; then fell in pools and
was swept away by driving gusts. Nought to be seen
there now but sea and sky in wild commotion; darkness
in all the air, blackness over all the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>But, despite the dreariness of the storm outside,
there was pleasing comfort within the cottage. The
increasing darkness of the night, the dashing rain and
the noisy wind, like unwelcome guests, came only to
the threshold and gained no admittance. A fire of
driftwood blazed in the big stone fireplace, and the soft
rays shed by a lamp suspended from the ceiling further
lighted up the cosy room.</p>
<p>There were four occupants of the room. Mrs. Warren,
a sweet-faced, cheery little woman, and the three
brothers, were seated about the fire. They were conversing
earnestly, and, as the talk progressed, it
seemed as though the influence of the storm was getting
into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, mother,&rdquo; said George Warren, who
stood in front of the fireplace, facing the others, &ldquo;trying
to make us think that Tom and Bob did not start
to cross the bay. Ever since the boys were out in the
big storm on Moosehead Lake they&rsquo;ve been afraid of
nothing. Tom Harris declares his canoe will stand
as rough a sea as a dory,&mdash;and, what&rsquo;s more, the
storm hadn&rsquo;t begun by the time they must have left
the mouth of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Captain Chase would warn them not to
cross.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt he did, mother; and, if he did, that
might make it so much the worse. If the boys had
been in a sailboat they probably would have listened
to him; but the captain would sneer at that canoe,
and would like as not tell them it wasn&rsquo;t fit to cross
the bay in at any time, much less in rough water.
And that would be just enough to put them on their
mettle. They&rsquo;d make the attempt, even if they had
to put back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Tom said in the note that they would
be here to-night,&rdquo; broke in young Joe. &ldquo;And when
he gave that to Captain Chase to bring, it showed he
meant to start, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the storm increased they would put
back,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;they must have gotten
two-thirds of the way across the bay before the worst
of the storm broke. The storm seemed to hold up
for an hour or two during the latter part of the afternoon,
and then increased all of a sudden with the
turn of the tide. The boys would have gotten so far
across that it would be too late to turn back, and they
would have to keep on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you boys want to imitate their recklessness!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Warren, impatiently. &ldquo;Come,
Arthur,&rdquo; and she turned to the boy who had remained
silent thus far during the discussion. &ldquo;Help me convince
your brothers of their mistake. You don&rsquo;t agree
with them, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy thus addressed, though a year younger than
his elder brother, was the one on whose judgment
the mother more often relied. He was fully as active
as the other two, but his was a calmer temperament
than theirs. This confidence in him really extended
to his brothers, though they joked him on his moderate,
studious ways, and called him the &ldquo;professor,&rdquo;
because he was a little near-sighted and sometimes
wore glasses. He came forward now and stood by
his mother&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking, mother, that George and
Joe are right,&rdquo; he said, deliberately, while poor Mrs.
Warren gasped with dismay. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have
us play the parts of cowards while the boys may be
in danger, and when we can perhaps save them. There
isn&rsquo;t half the danger you imagine, either. The wind
is blowing now squarely from the east, and once we
have beaten out of the cove we can sail alongshore
without heading out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, too,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the yacht is nearly
new, and was fitted with new rigging this year. We&rsquo;ll
promise to sail only a little past the head of the island
and return, or run into Bryant&rsquo;s Cove and walk back.
It&rsquo;s no more than we ought to do for the best friends
we&rsquo;ve got. There&rsquo;s not another sailboat in the harbour
to-night that is as stiff as ours, except Jack
Harvey&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s out of the question to ask him. The
other boats went out to the races at Seal Harbour,
or we would get Captain Sam to go in his yacht. We
can&rsquo;t ask Jack Harvey to go&mdash;that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he laugh at us, though!&rdquo; said George.
&ldquo;He would offer to tow our boat along, too, or something
of that sort, just to be mean, and then there&rsquo;d
be a nice row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besieged on all sides, Mrs. Warren could but yield
a partial consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and George can go,&rdquo; she said, turning to
Arthur, &ldquo;but Joe must stay with me. I can&rsquo;t spare
you all to take such an awful risk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay!&rdquo; cried young Joe, hotly. &ldquo;That is
to say, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he hastened to add, as
Mrs. Warren looked reproachfully at him. &ldquo;They
need me to help sail the <i>Spray</i>,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be three to manage the boat in
this wind,&rdquo; said George, somewhat reluctantly. &ldquo;I
guess you&rsquo;ll have to let him go, mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at this moment there was the sound of footsteps
upon the piazza. Some one walked around the house,
gave a premonitory knock at the door, and let himself
in.</p>
<p>It was Henry Burns. He was equipped for the
storm, in oilskins, rubber boots, and a tarpaulin hat.
The water ran from his clothing in little streams and
made a series of pools on the polished wood floor.
Declining Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s offer of a seat, on the ground
that he was too wet, Henry Burns stood by the mantel
near the fireplace, and, with tarpaulin removed, still
looked the pale and delicate student, despite his rough
garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there, shipmates,&rdquo; he said, with great
gravity, waving the tarpaulin at the group. &ldquo;You
weren&rsquo;t thinking of cruising for your health this evening,
were you? Because, if you were, my health isn&rsquo;t
as good as it might be, and I think a little salt air
would do it good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried George Warren. &ldquo;You might
know Henry Burns would be on hand if there was
any excitement going on. Never knew him to fail,&mdash;Joe,
you&rsquo;ll have to stay at home now and keep mother
company. We don&rsquo;t need more than three. Come,
Arthur, hurry! We mustn&rsquo;t lose a minute longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>And while young Joe turned away, almost in tears
at the verdict, the other two boys scrambled about,
hastily donning reefers, oilskins, and heavy boots.
Then they were gone with a rush and a bang of the
door, and Mrs. Warren and Joe composed themselves
as best they could to await their return.</p>
<p>And could any of them have imagined then, looking
forth through the darkness and the storm, an overturned
canoe pounding helplessly upon the beach of
that island shore, it surely would not have comforted
the watchers nor have given courage to those who
went forth to rescue.</p>
<p>Descending the bank to the shore of the cove, the
boys quickly launched a rowboat, the tender to the
yacht, and, with Henry Burns seated in the stern,
tiller-ropes in hand, the brothers, about equal in
strength, pulled vigorously across the cove, where the
sloop lay at anchor under the lee of the bluff. It
was no easy task to cross the cove in that sea; and
often Henry Burns turned the boat from its course
and headed out toward the entrance, to meet some
enormous wave that, had it broken over the side of
the boat, would have filled and swamped it.</p>
<p>The yacht <i>Spray</i>, sheltered as it was from the brunt
of the storm, was tossing about uneasily as the boys
climbed aboard and made the tender fast astern. It
was a small craft, about twenty-five feet over all,
with the hull painted black. It was trim and was able
for its size, but, safe to say, not a fisherman in the
village would have cared to put out in it this night.
Still, the boat had been built on an outer island of
the bay for fishing in heavy weather, and was seaworthy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>There were three sets of reefing-points in the mainsail,
and, after some discussion, it was decided to reef
the sail down to its smallest size. While Henry Burns
hoisted the sail slightly, the brothers hastily tied in
the reefs, and the halyards were then drawn taut at
throat and peak and made fast. The tender was tied
to the buoy. There was no use trying to tow it in
that sea. Then, with George Warren at the tiller,
Arthur and Henry Burns cast off, and the voyage was
begun.</p>
<p>When Mr. Warren purchased the boat for his boys,
he had it rigged with especial care for an emergency.
The main-sheet was rigged to run through a double
set of pulleys, so that the mainsail could be hauled
with comparative ease in a heavy gale. The sail he
had cut down smaller than the boat had been carrying,
so there was less danger of her capsizing. That
very precaution was, however, to prove a source of
trouble on this particular night.</p>
<p>Arthur Warren and Henry Burns now came aft, the
iron centreboard was dropped, and the yacht was
almost instantly under headway, standing out by the
bluff and heading almost directly across the cove.
Arthur Warren held the main-sheet, while Henry
Burns seated himself, with feet braced against the
centreboard-box, ready for any emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>For a moment they were in comparatively smooth
water, and then, as they emerged from the lee of the
headland, it seemed as though they had been suddenly
transported into another sea. The wind that struck
them careened the boat over violently, as they were
as yet under but little headway. Easing the yacht
for a moment with the sheet, they righted somewhat,
but the prospect was not pleasing. The <i>Spray</i> did not
head into the wind well, and they soon found they
could not make even a straight course across the
harbour, with the slant of wind they had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may make something on the next tack,&rdquo; said
George, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t look very encouraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing you see how she comes about before
we run in near shore,&rdquo; suggested Arthur, after some
minutes.</p>
<p>In answer, George put the tiller hard down, after
giving the little boat a good headway. The yacht
went sluggishly in stays, hung almost in the eye of
the wind for a moment, and then, failing to make
headway against the heavy seas, fell off once more
and would not come about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing we can do, boys,&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;We must run in under the shelter of the
wharf and shake out that last reef. The sail is too
small to reef down so close. I&rsquo;m sure she will beat
under a double reef. It&rsquo;s the only thing left to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the work of but a few minutes to carry
out this plan. The third reef was shaken out and
the sail hoisted. Once more the yacht emerged from
shelter. The change for the better in its working was
at once apparent. It pointed higher into the wind,
though careening over so that the water came unpleasantly
near the top of the high wash-boards. But
the yacht would stand this. The question now to be
tested was, would she act and come about under the
still small sail she was carrying against the force of
such a sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said George, as they neared the bluff
again, &ldquo;we will try her once more. If she fails now
we are beaten. We cannot carry more sail. That&rsquo;s
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the tiller down as he spoke, and the <i>Spray</i>,
responding bravely, headed into the seas. They strove
angrily to overwhelm the little craft, and dashed furiously
against her bows, while the wind worried the
flapping sails as though it would tear them from boom
and mast; but the <i>Spray</i> held on and came about
nobly, and they were away again on the other tack,
standing across the harbour.</p>
<p>It seemed an hour before they had beaten out where
they dared to stand past the bluff and head alongshore.
They had left all shelter hopelessly behind; on one
side of them a wilderness of foaming waves rushed
upon them from the darkness; on the other side lay
the lee shore, high and rock-bound for the most part,
but now and then broken by small stretches of beach.
Against the former, the seas broke with heavy crashings;
upon the other, with an ominous booming.</p>
<p>But they headed off the wind a trifle, eased the
sheet, made by the point, and stood along the shore as
near as they dared to run. It was well for them that
the little yacht was a good sea boat. Again and again,
as some wave, lifting its white crest above the others,
threatened to overwhelm them, the yacht was headed
out to sea, and then the wave, lifting the boat high
on its crest and rolling rapidly from beneath it till
half the length of the yacht seemed poised in air,
left it to fall heavily upon the next oncoming wave,
or, worse still, to plunge into a watery gulf, there
to be half-buried by the next big sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>But the yacht lived through it all and kept bravely
on its course. Henry Burns&rsquo;s arms ached with bailing
out the cockpit, where the seas broke in over the
quarter, or came aboard in clouds of spray as they
headed into the wind.</p>
<p>They dared not sail near the shore, and could see
it but indistinctly, save when some larger wave broke
upon the beach and carved out a white line of foam,
which vanished as quickly as it appeared. So against
the cliffs that they passed they could see a sudden
blur of white as a big wave hurled itself to destruction.
Beyond this all was blear and indistinct.</p>
<p>They were now within half a mile of the head of
the island, and, looking ahead into the darkness, which,
with the rain, had greatly increased within the last
hour, like the beginning of a fog, they realized how
useless was the search they had begun. They could
see but the merest distance in any direction. The
storm was steadily increasing, and already a new
condition confronted them. The wind was shifting to
the southeast, from east, so that their return was rendered
impossible. It was worse than folly to think
of beating back in such a head sea. The wind on
their quarter was driving them along furiously. It
was madness to dream of keeping on past the head of
the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make Bryant&rsquo;s Cove any too soon to
suit me,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;The <i>Spray</i> has got more
wind now than she knows what to do with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The little boat was, indeed, burying her bows under
at every plunge, and trembled in all her timbers at the
fearful strain. It was plain that she had reached the
limit of her seaworthiness. Bryant&rsquo;s Cove was a short
distance around the head of the island. Once there,
they would be sheltered from the storm.</p>
<p>The boys had ceased to speak of a possible rescue
of their friends. It was a question of their own salvation
now, and the instinct of self-preservation asserted
itself. Henry Burns peered eagerly ahead, but looked
only for the point of land behind which lay their
safety. Suddenly he turned and uttered a shrill cry
of fright, such as no one had ever heard from him
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luff her, George! Luff quick&mdash;quick, for your
life!&rdquo; he cried, and, springing for the tiller, threw
his weight against it ere the startled helmsman could
find strength to act.</p>
<p>The yacht, with sails slatting, came into the wind
amid a cloud of spray. The boom, striking a wave,
had nearly snapped in two. But it was not an instant
too soon.</p>
<p>A black object that looked enormous rose suddenly
out of the sea in front of the <i>Spray</i>. The next wave
lifted it high in the air, and hurled it down upon them.
It was a ship&rsquo;s yawl-boat, of immense size, fully as
large as the yacht itself. Down the watery declivity
it shot, swift and straight, like some sea-monster in
pursuit of its quarry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>But the little yacht had answered her helm well.
There was a crash and a splintering of wood, and
the yawl drifted rapidly past and was lost in the
darkness. The yacht <i>Spray</i>, her bowsprit and fore-rigging
torn away, once more fell off the wind and
was driven on by the storm. It was an escape so
narrow that a moment more and they had been dashed
to pieces.</p>
<p>Henry Burns was the first to regain his courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better the bowsprit than the rudder,&rdquo; he said,
coolly. And his courage gave them strength. A few
minutes later they had passed the head of the island
and gained the lee of the land, and in fifteen minutes
more they had cast anchor in Bryant&rsquo;s Cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing to do whatever you boys think is
best,&rdquo; said George Warren, as they lowered and furled
the sail and made the yacht snug for the night. &ldquo;But
I think it&rsquo;s of no use for us to make any search for
the boys along this shore. If they capsized in the
bay to-night, neither they nor their canoe would come
ashore here. The canoe would be blown across the
bay; and they&mdash; Well, we&rsquo;re bound to believe that
they didn&rsquo;t start, or, if they did, that they put back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but what we have done all we can
to-night,&rdquo; responded his brother; &ldquo;and, as we have
got five miles of muddy road to travel, the sooner
we start the better. We could stay in the boat to-night,
but we must get back on mother&rsquo;s account.
Depend upon it, she has worried every single minute
we have been gone, and I don&rsquo;t blame her, either.
Now it&rsquo;s all over, I don&rsquo;t mind saying I think we were
fools to come out. But we meant well, so perhaps the
less said the better. We&rsquo;ll have to leave the <i>Spray</i> to
herself till the storm goes down. Nobody will harm
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind staying here to-night and looking
after her,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;To be sure, old
Witham doesn&rsquo;t know I have left the hotel, but I
tumbled my bed up before I came away, and he will
only think I got up early in the morning, if he wonders
where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, old fellow. We won&rsquo;t let you stay. We
won&rsquo;t hear of it,&rdquo; said both brothers. &ldquo;The sooner
we all get home and get dry clothes on, the better.
There&rsquo;s no need of any of us staying. The <i>Spray</i>
won&rsquo;t sail out of the cove of herself, and every one
on the island knows her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, as they had left the tender behind, they removed
their clothing, tied it into bundles, slung them
around their necks, and, slipping overboard, swam to
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever was more glad to get on land alive than
I am at present,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, his teeth chattering
with the cold, as he hastily scrambled into his
clothes, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t happen to remember it just at this
instant. I wonder if my aunt would send me down
here again for my health if she could see me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so ludicrous in the idea that
the boys could not help bursting into roars of laughter,&mdash;though
they felt little enough like merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more I think of it,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, &ldquo;the
more I believe the boys are snug ashore at Millville,
and that they haven&rsquo;t been within ten miles of Grand
Island to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are right, Henry,&rdquo; responded Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>And yet not one of them dared to believe absolutely
that what he said was true.</p>
<p>They started off across lots now, walking as rapidly
as their wet and heavy clothing would allow, to strike
the road which led to the harbour. Coming at length
into this road, they had walked but a short distance,
and were at the top of a hill at a turn of the road
where it left the shore, when Henry Burns, pointing
down along the shore, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to remember that part of the bay as
long as we live, for we shall never be much nearer
to death than we were right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; responded Arthur, &ldquo;it was just
about off there that the big yawl smashed our bowsprit
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yawl must have been driven ashore by this
time,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Wait a minute and I will take
a look.&rdquo; And he disappeared over the bank and was
lost in the bushes. The two boys seated themselves
by the side of the road to await his return, but started
up with a horror in their hearts as a shrill cry came
up to them from the shore. There was that in the
cry that told them that George Warren had found
other than the ship&rsquo;s long-boat. They scarcely dared
to think what. Then they, too, dashed down the slope
to the shore.</p>
<p>When they reached his side, George Warren could
scarcely speak from emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; he cried, in a trembling, choking
voice, and pointed out upon the beach where the tide
had gone down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>There were two strange objects there that the sea
had buffeted in its wild play that night, and then, as
though grown tired of them, had cast upon the shore,
among the rocks and seaweed.</p>
<p>One was the long-boat, no longer an object of
danger, for the sea had hurled it against a rock and
stove its side in. The other was a canoe. The sea
had overturned it and tossed it upon the shore. Two
of its thwarts were smashed where it had been dropped
down and pinioned upon a rock&mdash;and the rock held it
fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">A SURPRISE</span></h2>
<p>With hearts beating quick and hard, they
lifted the canoe from the rock, fearful of
what they might find beneath it; but there
was nothing there. Then they searched along the
beach in the darkness as best they could, peering anxiously
into clumps of seaweed, and standing now and
again fixed with horror as some dim object, cast up
by the sea, assumed in shadowy outline the semblance
of a human form. The shore was heaped here and
there with piles of driftwood and ends of logs that
had come down through countless tides and currents
from the lumber-mills miles up the river, and this
stuff had lodged among the ledges and boulders at
various points along the beach. Here and there among
these they hunted, groping amid the seaweed, cold and
chill to the touch, and suggesting to their minds,
already alert with dread, the most gruesome of discoveries
which they feared to make.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>That the boys had crossed the bay in the frail craft
which they had just found there seemed to be no
possible doubt. Furthermore, they were now led to
believe that Tom and Bob, having once reached a point
where they could have found shelter, had chosen to
keep on past the head of the island in an effort to
make the harbour of Southport. They must at least,
as the wind had blown, have reached a point opposite
where the boys had found the canoe, and have, perhaps,
paddled some distance beyond.</p>
<p>But it was clearly useless to continue the search
further in the darkness and storm. They lifted the
canoe and carried it up from the beach, and hid it in
the bushes upon the bank. Then they went slowly
back to the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what we can do,&rdquo; said Arthur Warren.
&ldquo;I hate to go back to the cottage without making one
more search. Let&rsquo;s get a lantern and come back. We
shall not have to go far for one,&mdash;and we shall have
done all we can, then, though it is a bad night to
see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rain was, indeed, pouring in torrents and driving
in sheets against their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must do that much,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;And
then&mdash;then we can come back in the morning&mdash;&rdquo;
His voice choked, and he could not say more. They
went on down the muddy road in silence.</p>
<p>Shortly below the hill, upon the road, was a big
farmhouse, arriving at which they turned into the
yard. The house was in darkness, save one dim light
in a chamber; but they pounded at the door with the
heavy brass knocker till they heard the shuffling of
feet in the entry, and a voice inquired roughly what
was wanted. They answered, and the door was
opened cautiously a few inches, where it was held
fast by a heavy chain. An old man&rsquo;s face peered out
at them. The sight of the boys was evidently reassuring,
for, in a moment more, the man threw open
the door and invited them to walk in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There be rough sailors come by some nights,&rdquo; he
said, in a manner apologizing for his suspicion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
here alone, and&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice to a husky
whisper&mdash;&ldquo;they do say that I have a bit of money
hid away in the old house. But it&rsquo;s a lie. It&rsquo;s a lie.
It&rsquo;s the sea and the garden I live on. There&rsquo;s not a
bit of money in the old house. But what brings you
out in such a storm? You haven&rsquo;t lost your way,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They told their story, while the old man sat in
a chair, shaking his head dubiously. When they told
him of the finding of the canoe, and their certainty
that the boys had crossed in it, he declared that it
could never have lived to get to the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have come from down below,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It could never have been paddled across the bay
against this sea. Two boys, d&rsquo;ye say, paddled it? No.
No, my lads, never&mdash;upon my life, never. Two stout
men in a dory, and used to these waters, might have
done it; but two lads in a cockle-shell like that would
never have reached the Head, let alone getting beyond
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to regard them almost with suspicion,
when they told him of how they had sailed up along
shore in search of their comrades, and was perhaps
inclined to believe their whole story as some kind of
a hoax. Certain it was he gave them little comfort,
except to say he would look alongshore in the morning.
If any one had drowned offshore in the evening,
they might not come ashore till the next day, he
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>But he got a battered lantern for them and handed
it over with a trembling hand, cautioning them to be
careful of it, and to leave it by the door on their way
back. They heard him bolt the heavy door behind
them as they turned out of the yard into the road. A
clock in the kitchen had struck the hour of ten as
they left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it very probable, after all,&rdquo; said George, as
they walked along, &ldquo;that the man may be right, and
that this canoe we have found is one that has been
lost off some steamer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me perhaps as probable,&rdquo; answered
Henry Burns, &ldquo;as that the boys should have attempted
to keep on in the storm, having once reached a place
of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;But I
can&rsquo;t help fearing the worst,&mdash;and if the boys are
lost,&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen all I want to
of this island for one summer. I&rsquo;d never enjoy another
day here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s their canoe until I have to,&rdquo;
said George. &ldquo;They are not such reckless chaps as
we have been making them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he tried to say this bravely, as though he really
meant it.</p>
<p>They tramped along the rest of the way to the shore
in silence, for none of them dared to admit to another
that which he could not but believe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>By the lantern&rsquo;s dim and flickering light they
searched the beach again for a half-mile along in the
vicinity of where the canoe had come ashore. But
nothing rewarded their hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man must be right,&rdquo; said George Warren.
&ldquo;The canoe must have come ashore from some
steamer. Let&rsquo;s go home, anyway. We&rsquo;ve done all
we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heart-sick and weary, they began the tramp
back to the cottage. At about a mile from the old
farmhouse, where they left the lantern, they turned
off from the road and made a cut across fields, till
they came at length to the shore of the cove opposite
the Warren cottage. They could see across the water
the gleam of a large lantern which young Joe had
hung on the piazza for them; but the boat they had
expected to find drawn up on shore was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Slade must be over in town,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns; &ldquo;and he won&rsquo;t be back to-night, probably. So
it&rsquo;s either walk two miles more around the cove or
swim out to the tender. We&rsquo;re all of us tired out.
Shall we draw lots to see who swims?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, myself,&rdquo; volunteered George. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
swim that short distance than do any more walking.
I&rsquo;m about done up, but I am good for that much.&rdquo;
And he threw off his clothing once more, and swam
pluckily out to the tender and brought it ashore. They
pulled across the cove to the shore back of the cottage,
and, springing out, carried the boat high up on land.</p>
<p>They were at the cottage then in a twinkling; but,
even before they had reached the door, dear Mrs.
Warren, who had heard their steps upon the walk,
was outside in the rain, hugging her boys who had
braved the storm and who had come back safe. She
was altogether too much overcome at the sight of
them, it seemed, to inquire if they had found those
in search of whom they had set out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>And then the dear little woman, having embraced
and kissed them as though they had been shipwrecked
mariners, long given up for lost,&mdash;not forgetting
Henry Burns, who wasn&rsquo;t used to it, but who took
it calmly all the same, as he did everything else,&mdash;hurried
them into the kitchen, where young Joe
had the big cook-stove all of a red heat, and where dry
clothing for the three from the extensive Warren
wardrobe was warming by the fire.</p>
<p>A comical welcome they got from young Joe, who
had been just as much worried as Mrs. Warren, but
who hadn&rsquo;t admitted it to his mother for a moment,
and had scornfully denied the existence of danger,
and yet who was every bit as relieved as she to see
the boys safe. He tried not to appear as though a
great weight had been removed from his mind by
their return, but made altogether a most commendable
failure.</p>
<p>The big, roomy, old-fashioned kitchen&mdash;for the
Warren cottage had originally been a rambling old
farmhouse, which they had remodelled and modernized&mdash;had
never seemed so cosy before. And the
fire had never seemed more cheery than it did now.
And when they had scrambled into dry, warm clothing,
and Mrs. Warren had taken the teakettle from
the hob, and poured them each a steaming cup of
tea, to &ldquo;draw out the chill,&rdquo; they forgot for the moment
what they had been through and their sad discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>In fact, it seemed as though Mrs. Warren and
young Joe were strangely indifferent to what had sent
them forth, and were easily satisfied with the opinions
expressed by the boys, who had agreed not to mention
the finding of the canoe until something more definite
was learned, that Tom and Bob had in all probability
not left the river.</p>
<p>So easily satisfied, indeed, and so little affected by
the fruitless errand they had been on, that all at once
Henry Burns, who had been eying Mrs. Warren
sharply for some moments, suddenly rose up from
where he was sitting, and rushed out of the kitchen,
through the dining-room, into the front part of the
house. Wondering what had come over him, the
others followed.</p>
<p>What they saw was a tableau, with Henry Burns
as exhibitor. He had drawn aside the heavy porti&egrave;re
with one hand, and stood pointing into the room
with the other.</p>
<p>There, seated before the fireplace, were two boys
so much like Tom and Bob, whom they had given up
for lost, that their own mothers, had they been there,
would have wept for joy at the sight of them. And
then, what with the Warren boys pounding them and
hugging them, like young bears, to make sure they
were flesh and blood, and not the ghosts of Tom and
Bob, and with the cheers that fairly made the old
rafters ring, and the happiness of Mrs. Warren, who
was always willing to adopt every boy from far and
near who was a friend of one of her boys,&mdash;what
with all this, there was altogether a scene that would
have done any one&rsquo;s heart good, and might have
shamed the storm outside, if it had been any other
kind of a storm than a pitiless southeaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Then, though the hour was getting late, they all
sat about the big fireplace, and Tom narrated the
story of the shipwreck.</p>
<p>But, just as he began, young Joe said, with mock
gravity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t introduced Henry Burns to the boys
yet. Henry, this is Tom Harris, and this is Bob
White.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need an introduction to one who
has risked his life for us,&rdquo; said Tom Harris, heartily,
as he and Bob sprang up to shake hands with Henry
Burns. But Henry Burns, carrying out the joke, bowed
very formally, and politely said he was extremely
happy to make their acquaintance. At which Tom
and Bob, unfamiliar with the ways of Henry Burns,
stared in astonishment, which sent the Warren boys
into roars of laughter.</p>
<p>The boys thus introduced to Henry Burns were
handsome young fellows, evidently about the same
age,&mdash;in fact, each lacked but a few months of fifteen,&mdash;thick-set
and strongly built. The sons of well-to-do
parents, and neighbours, they had been inseparable
companions ever since they could remember. Tom
Harris&rsquo;s father was the owner of extensive tracts in
the Maine woods, from which lumber was cut yearly
and rafted down the streams to his lumber-mills. In
company with him on several surveying and exploring
expeditions, the boys had hunted and fished together,
and had paddled for weeks along the streams and on
the lakes of the great Maine wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>They had hunted and fished in the Parmachenee
and the Rangeley Lake region, and knew a great deal
more of real camp life than most boys of double their
age. Further than this, they were schoolmates, and
were so equally matched in athletic sports, in which
they both excelled, that neither had ever been able to
gain a decided victory over the other. Tom was
of rather light complexion, while Bob was dark, with
curly, black hair.</p>
<p>It was through their friendship with the Warren
boys, who lived not far from them, in the same town,
that they had decided to spend the summer camping
on Grand Island.</p>
<p>As they all gathered around the cheerful blaze of
the fire, Tom told the story of the day&rsquo;s adventures.</p>
<p>With so much of their camp kit as they needed for
cooking along the river, they had started from the
town of Benton at about four o&rsquo;clock that morning,
just as the tide began to ebb. Hardened as they were
to the use of the paddle, by the time the tide had
ceased to ebb and slack water ensued, they had left
the city miles behind and were well down the river.</p>
<p>Then the flood tide began to set strong against them,
and a wind arose that furrowed the river with waves
that were not big enough to be noticeable to larger
craft, but which seriously impeded the progress of
the frail canoe. They kept steadily on, but made slow
headway.</p>
<p>At Millville, a few miles above the mouth of the
river, where it broadened out into the bay, they had
met the steamer, and had hastily scrawled the note
which Captain Chase had brought to the Warren boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Sure enough, Captain Chase had warned them of
the impending storm, and, furthermore, had offered
to transport them and their canoe across the bay; but
they had declined his offer, wishing to paddle the
entire distance to the island. They had set their hearts
on making the trip of forty miles in one day; and
partly for this reason, and partly because Captain
Chase had looked askance at their canoe, and had
assured them that it was not a fit craft for bay work
in any weather, let alone in a heavy sea, they had set
out, toward the latter part of the afternoon, to cross
the fifteen miles of bay which lay between them and
Grand Island.</p>
<p>The storm which had threatened gradually closed
in around them, but they held on stubbornly, until,
when too far across the bay to put back, it rapidly
gathered strength, and soon turned what had been a
comparatively safe pathway across the sea into a
wilderness of waves, that at one moment rose high
above the bow of the canoe, dashing them with spray
as the sharp canoe cleaved them, and the next dropped
down beneath them, opening a watery trench, into
which they plunged.</p>
<p>They had seen storms like this, that came quick and
sharp upon the lakes, heaving up a sea almost in a
moment, with squalls that swept down from the hills.
They had been safely through them before; but at
those times it had been a short, sharp battle for a half-hour
at most, before they could reach a friendly shore.
But here it was different. Here were miles of intervening
water between them and the nearest land. This
was no lake, to be quickly within the shelter of some
protecting point of land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>But they had never for a moment lost courage nor
despaired of coming through all right. They struggled
pluckily on, and might have gotten safely to land
without mishap, if they had been familiar with the
shore of the island. To a stranger, the shore about
the head of the island presented a sheer front of
forbidding cliffs, rising abruptly from the water, and
against which, in a storm, the sea dashed furiously.</p>
<p>There was apparently no place at which a boat could
be landed; and yet, hidden behind the very barrier
of ledge that sheltered it, lay Bryant&rsquo;s Cove, as quiet
and sequestered a pool as any fugitive craft could
wish to find. Had the boys known of its existence,
they would have landed there, and have been at the
Warren cottage before the <i>Spray</i> had left the harbour.</p>
<p>As it was, there seemed to them to be no alternative
but to keep on to a point about half a mile farther
along the shore, where they hoped to be able to make
a landing upon the beach.</p>
<p>They had accomplished the distance, and were fast
nearing a place where they could land in safety, when
a most unexpected and disastrous accident happened.
Suddenly, and without the slightest warning of its
weakness, the paddle which Bob was using snapped
in two in his hands. At the same moment a wave hit
the canoe, and, with nothing with which to keep his
balance, Bob was thrown bodily from the canoe into
the sea, upsetting the canoe and spilling Tom out at
the same time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>The boys were able to grasp the canoe and cling
on for a few minutes. They were both good swimmers,
and often, in smooth water, had practised
swimming, with the canoe upset, and were able to
accomplish the feat of righting it, bailing it with a
dipper, which they always carried attached to one of
the thwarts by a cord, and then climbing aboard over
the ends. But it was useless to attempt such a thing
in this boisterous sea.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was more than they could do, even, to
cling to the overturned craft, for soon an enormous
wave struck it a blow broadside and tore it from their
grasp. Then ensued a fight for life that seemed almost
hopeless. They were near to shore, but the sea seemed
to delight in mocking them; tossing them in at one
moment, so that they could grasp at seaweed that lay
above the ledges, and then clutching at them and drawing
them relentlessly back.</p>
<p>It was then that their athletic training stood them
in good stead. Less hardy constitutions and weaker
muscles than theirs would have quickly tired under
the strain. Refraining from useless struggles to gain
the shore, they waited their opportunity, and strove
merely for the moment to keep themselves afloat. In
this manner they were, several times, almost cast up
on shore.</p>
<p>All at once Tom Harris felt a sharp pain in his right
hand. Then he realized, with a thrill of hope, that he
had struck it upon a rock. It was, indeed, a narrow
reef that made out some distance from shore. They
had narrowly escaped being dashed upon it head-foremost.
Tom waited and gathered his strength as
the next wave hurled him on its crest in the direction
of the ledge. Then, as the wave bore him with great
force against it, he broke the force of the shock with
his hands, was thrown roughly up against it, and
managed to cling fast, with his fingers in a niche of
the rock, as the wave, receding, strove to drag him
back again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Then, holding on with one hand, he managed somehow
to grasp at Bob as he was drifting by, and hold
him fast and draw him in. Clinging to the ledge as
each succeeding wave broke over them, they waited
till they had regained their strength and recovered
their wind, and then slowly worked their way along
the ledge to shore, and at length were safe, out of the
sea&rsquo;s fury.</p>
<p>Then they had rested awhile, before setting out on
foot. Their canoe they could see at some distance out
from shore, tossing about at the mercy of the waves.
It must of necessity come ashore in due time, but it
might not be for an hour, and they resolved not to
wait for it, but to push on to their destination, returning
on the morrow to look for it. They followed
the shore for about a mile down the island, till they
met a fisherman, who told them how to get to the
Warren cottage by the same route the Warren boys
and Henry Burns had taken a few hours later.</p>
<p>They had crossed the cove in old Slade&rsquo;s boat, and,
expecting to astonish the Warren boys by their appearance,
in the midst of the storm, had found, to their
dismay, that those whom they had expected to find
safe at home were imperilling their lives for them out
in the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be up and moving,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns, when Tom had concluded his narrative. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mind saying I&rsquo;m a bit tired with this night&rsquo;s
work&mdash;and I guess you are, by the looks. I can
sleep, too, now that I know that you are not down
among the mermaids at the bottom of Samoset Bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay here with the boys to-night,
Henry?&rdquo; said Mrs. Warren. &ldquo;You cannot get into
the hotel at this hour of the night, without waking
everybody up. Colonel Witham closes up early, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one but Henry Burns can, mother,&rdquo; said Joe
Warren. &ldquo;Henry has a private staircase of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lightning-rod staircase, Mrs. Warren,&rdquo; explained
Henry Burns. &ldquo;I use it sometimes after ten
o&rsquo;clock, for that is my bedtime, you know. Mrs.
Carlin&mdash;good soul&mdash;sends me off to bed regularly
at that hour, no matter what is going on; and so
I have to make use of it occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Warren shook her head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t do it, Henry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Although
I know it is hard for a strong, healthy boy to go
off to bed every night at ten o&rsquo;clock. Well, that comes
of being too strict, I suppose,&mdash;but do look out and
don&rsquo;t break your neck. It&rsquo;s a bad night to be climbing
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Henry Burns, mother,&rdquo; said
Arthur. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t do it, if he wasn&rsquo;t forced to
it,&mdash;and he knows how to take care of himself, if
anybody does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good night,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t forget, I hold my reception to-morrow night;
and I extend to Tom and Bob a special invitation to
be present.&rdquo; And, with a knowing glance at George
Warren, Henry Burns took his departure.</p>
<p>As the boys went off to bed that night, George
Warren explained to them that on the next night,
the occasion being an entertainment in place of the regular
Wednesday night hop at the hotel, he and Henry
Burns had planned a joke on Colonel Witham, in
which they were all to take part, and, with this prospect
in view, they dropped asleep.</p>
<p>In the meantime Henry Burns, arriving at the hotel,
and having learned by previous experience that a lock
on a rear door of the old part of the hotel, which was
not connected with the new by any door, could be
manipulated with the aid of a thin blade of a jack-knife,
crept up to the garret by way of a rickety pair
of back stairs, and from thence emerged upon the
roof through a scuttle. Then, carefully making his
way along the ridge-pole to where the new part joined
the old, he climbed a short distance up a lightning-rod,
to the roof of the new part.</p>
<p>This was a large roof, nearly flat. He walked
across, about midway of the building, to where another
rod, fastened at the top to a chimney, came up. Clinging
to this, Henry Burns disappeared over the edge
of the roof, found a resting-place for his foot on a
projection which was directly over his own window,
and then lowered himself, like an acrobat, down the
rod to a veranda. Raising the window directly beside
the rod, he slipped inside, closed it softly, and in a
few minutes more was abed and sound asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>While all Southport slept, the storm spent its force,
and toward morning gradually subsided. In the place
of the beating rain there stole up through the islands,
in the early morning hours, great detached banks of
fog,&mdash;themselves like strange, white islands,&mdash;which
shut out the bay from the shore. They lay
heavy over the water, and, as the boisterous seas
gradually gave way to the long, smooth waves that
rolled in without breaking, one might have fancied
that the fog, itself, had a depressing and tranquillizing
influence upon the sea.</p>
<p>Yet old fishermen would have ventured out then,
without fear, for there were signs, that might be read
by the weather-wise, that a light west wind was soon
to be stirring that would scatter the fog at its first
advance, and sweep it back out to sea.</p>
<p>But, brief as was the visitation of the fog, it sufficed
to hide all things from sight. And if a boat,
in which one boy rowed vigorously, had put forth
from the camp of Jack Harvey, down in the woods,
and had come up along the shore to the wharf, and
the box, which was a part of the belongings of Tom
Harris and Bob White, had been lowered from the
wharf into the boat and conveyed back to the camp
and hidden away there,&mdash;if all this had happened,
it is safe to say that no one would have seen what
was done, nor would any one have been the wiser.</p>
<p>Perhaps some such a thing might, indeed, have occurred,
for when Tom and Bob, Henry Burns, and
the Warren boys met at the wharf the next fore-noon,
they found the box gone. They hunted everywhere,
ransacked the storehouse from one end to the
other, but it was nowhere to be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that it&rsquo;s all my fault,&rdquo; groaned young
Joe, as they stood at the edge of the wharf, after
the unsuccessful search. &ldquo;I might have known John
Briggs would forget to lock it up! It was left in
the open shed there, boys, protected from the rain,
and he promised to look out for it; but he must have
forgotten. I spoke to him about it the last thing last
night, on our way home to the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very valuable?&rdquo; asked Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Tom what he thinks,&rdquo; laughed Bob, while
Tom tried to look unconscious, but blushed furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pretty sister of mine,&rdquo; continued Bob,
&ldquo;that thinks so much of us that she spent a week
cooking up a lot of things for us to start our camping
with. There&rsquo;s a box full of the best stuff to eat
you ever tasted, that somebody will gobble up, I suppose,
without once thinking or caring about the one
that made them. Pretty tough, isn&rsquo;t it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom turned redder still, and felt of his biceps, as
though he was speculating what he would do to a
certain person, if that person could only be discovered
and come up with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, boys,&rdquo; said George Warren;
&ldquo;things have had a strange way of disappearing here
this summer, as they never did before; and, what&rsquo;s
more, if Jack Harvey and his crew haven&rsquo;t stolen
them, they have at least got the credit for taking the
most of it,&mdash;and you may depend upon it, that box
is down there in the woods, somewhere about that
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to hinder our raiding the camp and
getting it?&rdquo; Tom broke in, angrily. &ldquo;Bob and I,
with two of you, could make a good fight against all
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of that, Tom,&rdquo; answered George Warren;
&ldquo;but there are two things to be considered.
First, we want to get the box back; and, second, we
are not absolutely certain that they have it. If they
have it, you may be certain that it is carefully hidden
away, and we shouldn&rsquo;t recover it by making an attack
on them. We must find out where it is hidden first,
and then, if we cannot get it away otherwise, we will
fight for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems that we have two scores to settle now,&rdquo;
said Henry Burns, dryly. &ldquo;We owe a debt now to
Jack Harvey and his crew, and there&rsquo;s a long-standing
account with Colonel Witham, part of which we
must pay to-night. Be on hand early. The latch-string
will be out at number twenty-one.&rdquo; So saying,
Henry Burns left them.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon Tom and Bob, looking from
the door of their tent across the cove, saw a sight
that was at once familiar and strange. It was a canoe,
in which were two occupants, and it was being paddled
toward their camp. The long seas, smooth
though they were, still rolled in heavily, and the light
canoe tossed about on their crests like a mere toy.
Still, it did not take long for them to discover that
the canoe was their own. They had supposed it lost,
though they had intended to set out in search of it on
the following morning.</p>
<p>In the bow and stern, propelling the craft with paddles
roughly improvised from broken oars, were
George and Arthur Warren.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, old fellow,&rdquo; said Bob, as the canoe came
dancing toward them, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve lost the box, but we&rsquo;ve
got the luck with us, after all. Not only are we proof
against drowning, but we own a canoe that refuses
to be wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the bow of the canoe grated on the sandy
shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A NIGHT WITH HENRY BURNS</span></h2>
<p>Henry Burns, having neither father nor
mother living, had been taken in charge several
years before this by an elderly maiden
aunt, whose home was in the city of Medford, Massachusetts.
She was fairly well-to-do, and, as there had
been a moderate inheritance left in trust for the boy
by his parents, they were in comfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>But Henry Burns was made, unfortunately, to
realize that this does not necessarily mean a home,
with the happiness that the word implies. Good Miss
Matilda Burns, a sister of Henry&rsquo;s late father, never
having known the care of a family of her own, had
devoted her life to the interests of a half a score of
missions and ladies&rsquo; societies of different kinds, until
at length she had become so wrapped up in these that
there was really no room in her life left for the personality
of a boy to enter.</p>
<p>Henry Burns was a problem which she failed utterly
to solve. Perhaps she might have succeeded, if she
had seen fit to devote less of her time to her various
societies, and more to the boy. But she deemed the
former of far more importance, and felt her duty
for the day well performed, in the matter of his upbringing,
if she kept him out of mischief, saw that
he went off to school at the proper hour, and that
he did not fall ill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>To achieve two of these ends the most conveniently
to her, Miss Matilda exercised a restraint over Henry
Burns which was entirely unnecessary and altogether
too severe. Henry Burns was naturally of a studious
turn of mind, and cared more for a quiet evening with
a book than he did for playing pranks about the
neighbourhood at night. At the same time, he had a
healthy fondness for sports, and excelled in them.</p>
<p>He was captain of his ball team, until Miss Matilda
found it out and ordered him to stop playing the
game. She considered it too rough for boys, having
had no experience with boys of her own. And so on,
with swimming and several other of his healthful
sports. They were altogether too risky for Miss
Matilda&rsquo;s piece of mind. It came about that Henry
Burns, in order to take part with his companions in
their out-of-door sports, found it necessary to play
&ldquo;hookey&rdquo; and indulge in them without her knowing
it. He won a medal in a swimming-match, but never
dared to show it to Miss Matilda.</p>
<p>Withal a healthy and athletic youth, he had a pale
complexion, which deceived Miss Matilda into the
impression that he was sickly. He was slight of build,
too, which confirmed in her that impression. When
once her mind was made up, there was no convincing
Miss Matilda. The family doctor, called in by her
for an examination, found nothing the matter with
him; but that did not avail to alter her opinion. The
boy was delicate, she said, and must not be allowed
to overdo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Accordingly, she made life miserable for Henry
Burns. She kept a watchful eye over him, so far as
her other duties would admit of, sent him off to bed
at nine o&rsquo;clock, tried to dose him with home remedies,
which Henry Burns found it availed him best to
carry submissively to his room and then pitch out
of the window, and, in short, so worried over, meddled
with, and nagged at Henry Burns, that, if he had
been other than exactly what he was, she would have
succeeded in utterly spoiling him, or have made him
run away in sheer despair.</p>
<p>Henry Burns never got excited about things. He
had a coolness that defied annoyances and disappointments,
and a calm persistence that set him to studying
the best way out of a difficulty, instead of flying
into a passion over it. He had, in fact, without fully
appreciating it, the qualities of success.</p>
<p>If, as was true, he was a problem to Miss Matilda,
which she did not succeed in solving, it was not so
in the case of his dealings with her. He made a
study of her and of the situation in which he found
himself, and proceeded deliberately to take advantage
of what he discovered. He knew all her weaknesses
and little vanities to a degree that would have amazed
her, and cleverly used them to his advantage, in whatever
he wanted to do. Fortunately for her, he had
no inclination to bad habits, and, if he succeeded in
outwitting her, the worst use he made of it was to
indulge in some harmless joke, for he had, underlying
his quiet demeanour, an unusual fondness for mischief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>What to do with Henry Burns summers had been
a puzzle for some time to Miss Matilda. She was
accustomed, through these months, to visit an encampment,
or summer home, composed of several
ladies&rsquo; societies, and the presence of a boy was a
decided inconvenience. When, one day, she learned
that an old friend, one Mrs. Carlin, a fussy old soul
after her own heart, was engaged as housekeeper at
the Hotel Bayview, at Southport, on Grand Island, in
Samoset Bay, she conceived the idea of sending Henry
Burns there in charge of Mrs. Carlin.</p>
<p>So it came about that Henry Burns was duly
despatched to Maine for the summer, as a guest of
Colonel Witham. He had a room on the second floor,
next to that occupied by the colonel, who was supposed
also to exercise a guardianship over him. As
Colonel Witham&rsquo;s disposition was such that he disliked
nearly everybody, with the exception of Squire
Brackett, and as he had a particular aversion to boys
of all ages and sizes, he did not take pains to make
life agreeable to Henry Burns. He was suspicious
of him, as he was of all boys.</p>
<p>Boys, according to Colonel Witham&rsquo;s view of life,
were born for the purpose, or, at least, with the sole
mission in life, of annoying older people. Accordingly,
the worthy colonel lost no opportunity of thwarting
them and opposing them,&mdash;&ldquo;showing them where
they belonged,&rdquo; he called it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>But this disagreeable ambition on the part of the
colonel was not, unfortunately, confined to his attitude
toward boys. He exercised it toward every one with
whom he came in contact. Despite the fact that he
had a three years&rsquo; lease of the hotel, he took absolutely
no pains to make himself agreeable to any of his
guests. He looked upon them secretly as his natural
enemies, men and women and children whom he hoped
to get as much out of as was possible, and to give as
little as he could in return.</p>
<p>He was noted for his meanness and for his surly
disposition toward all. Then why did he come there
to keep a hotel? Because he had discovered that guests
would come, whether they were treated well or not.
The place had too many attractions of boating, swimming,
sailing, and excellent fishing, winding wood-roads,
and a thousand and one natural beauties, to be
denied. Guests left in the fall, vowing they would not
put up with the colonel&rsquo;s niggardliness and petty impositions
another year; but the following season found
them registered there again, with the same cordial
antipathy existing as before between them and their
landlord.</p>
<p>In person, Colonel Witham was decidedly corpulent,
with a fiery red face, which turned purple when he
became angry&mdash;which was upon the slightest occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another boy come to annoy me with his
noise and tomfoolery,&rdquo; was the colonel&rsquo;s inward comment,
when Mrs. Carlin, the housekeeper, informed
him that Henry Burns was coming, and was to be
under her charge.</p>
<p>So the colonel gave him the room next to his, where
he could keep an eye on him, and see that he was in
his room every night not later than ten o&rsquo;clock, for
that was the hour Mrs. Carlin had set for that young
gentleman&rsquo;s bedtime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Henry Burns, having in due time made the acquaintance
of the Warren boys, as well as a few other
youths of his age, had no idea of ending up his evenings&rsquo;
entertainments at ten o&rsquo;clock each and every
night; so he set about to discover some means of evading
the espionage of the colonel and Mrs. Carlin. It did
not take him more than one evening of experimenting
to find that, by stepping out on to the veranda that ran
past his own and Colonel Witham&rsquo;s windows, he could
gain the ascent to the roof by a clever bit of acrobatics
up a lightning-rod. Once there, he found he
could reach the ground by way of the old part of the
hotel, in the manner before described. It is only fair
to Henry Burns to state that he did not take undue
advantage of this discovery, but kept on the whole
as good hours as most boys of his age. Still, if there
was a clambake, or some other moonlight jollification,
at the extreme end of the island, where Henry Burns
had made friends among a little fishing community,
he was now and then to be seen, sometimes as the
village clock was proclaiming a much later hour than
that prescribed by Mrs. Carlin, spinning along on his
bicycle like a ghost awheel. He was generally known
and well liked throughout the entire island.</p>
<p>On the night following the arrival of Tom and Bob,
the sounds of a violin, a clarionet, and a piano, coming
from the big parlour of the Hotel Bayview, told that
a dance was in progress. These dances, withal the
music was provided by the guests themselves, were extremely
irritating to Colonel Witham. They meant
late hours for everybody, more lights to be furnished,
more guests late to breakfast on the following morning,
and, on the whole, an evening of noise and excitement,
which interfered more or less with his invariable
habit of going to bed at a quarter after ten o&rsquo;clock
every night of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>They brought, moreover, a crowd of cottagers to
the hotel, who were given anything but a cordial
welcome by Colonel Witham. He argued that they
spent no money at his hotel, and were, therefore, only
in the way, besides adding to the noise.</p>
<p>The guests at the Bayview were, on the whole, accustomed
to the ways of Colonel Witham by experience,
and really paid but little attention to him.
They went ahead, planned their own dances and card-parties,
and left him to make the best of it.</p>
<p>This particular evening&rsquo;s entertainment was rather
out of the ordinary, inasmuch as it was given by a
Mr. and Mrs. Wellington, of New York, in honour of
their daughter&rsquo;s birthday, and, on her account, invitations
to the spread, which was to be served after
the dancing, were extended to the young people of the
hotel. In these invitations Henry Burns had, of course,
been included; but Mrs. Carlin and Colonel Witham
were obdurate. It was too late an hour for him; his
eating of rich salads and ices was not to be thought
of; in short, he must decline, or they must decline
for him, and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, Henry,&rdquo; said good-hearted
Bridget Carrington, who was Mrs. Carlin&rsquo;s assistant,
and with whom Henry Burns had made friendship.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you that&rsquo;ll be going without some of the
salad and the ice-cream, not if I know it. Sure, and
Mrs. Wellington says you&rsquo;re to have some, too. So
just breathe easy, and there&rsquo;ll be a bit for you and a
little more, too, a-waitin&rsquo; just outside the kitchen
window about nine o&rsquo;clock. So go on now and say
never a word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>So Henry Burns, with the connivance of Bridget,
and by the judicious outlay of a part of his own
pocket-money, in the matter of sweet things and other
delicacies dear to youthful appetites, had prepared and
planned for a small banquet of his own in his room,
next to that of Colonel Witham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you manage so that Colonel Witham
won&rsquo;t hear us, as he will be right alongside of us?&rdquo;
George Warren, who was a partner in Henry Burns&rsquo;s
enterprise, had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.</p>
<p>The evening wore on; the strains of the music
sounded merrily along the halls; dancing was in full
swing,&mdash;everybody seemed to be enjoying the occasion,
save Colonel Witham. He had at least conceded
to the occasion the courtesy of a black frock coat and
an immaculate white tie, but he was plainly ill at ease.
He stood in the office, the door of which was open into
the parlour, his hands twisting nervously behind his
back, while he glanced, with no good humour in his
expression, now at the blaze of lights in the parlour,
and now at the clock, which, however, even under his
impatient gaze, only ticked along in its most provokingly
methodical fashion.</p>
<p>The outer door opened and in walked young Joe
Warren, recognized by Colonel Witham as one of the
plagues of his summer existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Colonel Witham,&rdquo; said young Joe,
with studied politeness, and in a tone that ostensibly
anticipated an equally cordial response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; snapped the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Colonel Witham,&rdquo; chimed Arthur
Warren, close at his brother&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p>The colonel responded gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, colonel,&rdquo; came an equally cordial
greeting from Tom and Bob, and from George Warren,
smiling at Colonel Witham, as though he had
extended them a hearty invitation to be present.</p>
<p>The colonel snorted impatiently, while the colour in
his red face deepened. He did not respond to their
salutations.</p>
<p>The boys seated themselves comfortably in the office
chairs, and listened to the music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get Henry
Burns to go off with you,&rdquo; the colonel said, finally.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half-past nine now, and his bedtime is ten o&rsquo;clock.
I wonder where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Warren chuckled quietly to himself. He
could have told the colonel just where Henry Burns
was at that moment; that he was busily engaged in
conveying a certain basket of supplies from outside
the kitchen window, up a pair of back stairs, to his
room on the second floor above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go and keep an eye on Colonel Witham,&rdquo; he
had said to Arthur Warren, &ldquo;and if he starts to look
for me, you go to the door and whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which accounted for the sudden appearance of all
the Warrens and Tom and Bob in the presence of
Colonel Witham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes elapsed, and one by one they had all
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; was the colonel&rsquo;s mental ejaculation
when he found them gone.</p>
<p>Great would have been his amazement and indignation
could he have but seen them, a few minutes
later, seated comfortably on the bed in Henry Burns&rsquo;s
room. It was approaching ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bob?&rdquo; asked Henry Burns, as the boys
quietly entered, and he made the door fast behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said Tom, shaking his head regretfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad thing about Bob. It&rsquo;s too bad, but I don&rsquo;t
think he will be here, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed Henry
Burns, with surprise. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t hurt, is he? I saw
him a few hours ago, and he seemed all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t hurt,&mdash;at least, not the way you
mean, Henry. The fact is, he was dancing out on the
piazza about half an hour ago with pretty little Miss
Wilson,&mdash;you know, the one in the cottage down
on the shore,&mdash;and the last I saw of Bob he was
escorting her home. I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have to give
him up for to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, solemnly, as
though some grievous misfortune had come upon
Tom&rsquo;s chum. &ldquo;And the worst of it is, it may last
all summer. Well, Bob will miss a very pleasant
surprise-party to Colonel Witham, to say nothing of
the spread. That, by the way, is stowed away in
those baskets over behind the bed and the wash-stand,&mdash;but,
first, we&rsquo;ve got to clear the coast of
Colonel Witham.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re yours to command, Henry,&rdquo; replied George
Warren. &ldquo;Tell us what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, opening
one of his windows that led out on to the veranda,
as he spoke, &ldquo;the rest of you just listen as hard as
ever you can at my door, while George and I make a
brief visit to the colonel&rsquo;s room. If you hear footsteps,
just pound on the wall, so we can get back in
time. It&rsquo;s pretty certain he won&rsquo;t be here, though,
until we are ready for him. He hasn&rsquo;t missed a night
in weeks in getting to bed exactly at a quarter past
ten o&rsquo;clock. He&rsquo;s as regular as a steamboat; always
on time. And he&rsquo;s a good deal like a steamboat, too,
for he snores like a fog-horn all night long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns and George Warren disappeared
through the window and were gone but a moment,
when they reappeared, each bearing in one hand
a lamp from the colonel&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel is always talking about economy,&rdquo;
explained Henry Burns, &ldquo;so I am not going to let
him burn any oil to-night, if I can help it. My lamps
happen to need filling,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve borrowed an extra one
for this occasion, and so, you see, I don&rsquo;t intend to
waste any of the colonel&rsquo;s oil by throwing it away.
I&rsquo;ll see that not a drop of the colonel&rsquo;s oil is wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns carefully proceeded to pour the oil
from each lamp which he and George Warren had
brought from the colonel&rsquo;s room into those in his own
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s enough oil in each of
those wicks to burn for several minutes, so the colonel
will have a little light to start in on. But we don&rsquo;t
want to return his lamps empty, and so I&rsquo;ll just fill
them up again. I&rsquo;m sure the colonel would approve
of this economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Henry Burns carefully refilled the colonel&rsquo;s
lamps from his water-pitcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t burn very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
sure it looks better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll just take these back again,&rdquo; he continued,
addressing George Warren. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s
another little matter we want to arrange while we are
in there. The colonel is always finding fault with the
housemaids. Now we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t improve on
their work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the two boys disappeared, while the remaining
three stood watch against the colonel&rsquo;s sudden
appearance.</p>
<p>Once in the colonel&rsquo;s room, Henry Burns seized
hold of the bedclothes and threw them over the foot-board.
Then he snatched out three of the slats from
the middle of the bed, replacing them with three
slender sticks, which he had brought from his own
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those will do to support the bedclothes and the
mattress,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;m really afraid
they would break if any one who was kind of heavy
should put his weight on them.&rdquo; Then he carefully
replaced the mattress and the bedclothes, making up
the colonel&rsquo;s bed again in the most approved style, with
his friend&rsquo;s assistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You take notice,&rdquo; he said to George Warren, as
he opened a closet door in the colonel&rsquo;s room, &ldquo;that
I am careful to destroy nothing of the colonel&rsquo;s property.
I might have sawed these slats in two, and left
them just hanging so they would support the bedclothes,
and would not have been any more trouble;
but, being of a highly conscientious nature, I carefully
put the colonel&rsquo;s property away, where it can be found
later and restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the colonel wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate your
thoughtfulness,&rdquo; said George Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s often the reward of those who try to look after
another&rsquo;s interests. However, I&rsquo;ll put these slats in
this closet, shut and lock the door, and put the key
here on the mantelpiece, just behind this picture. It
would be just as easy to hide the key, but I don&rsquo;t
think that would be right, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; laughed George Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, taking a final survey
of everything. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all we can, I&rsquo;m sure,
to provide for the colonel&rsquo;s comfort. If he chooses to
find fault with it, it will surely be from force of habit.&rdquo;
They took their departure by way of the colonel&rsquo;s
window, closing it after them, and quickly rejoined
their companions in the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deeply regret,&rdquo; said Henry Burns to his guests,
&ldquo;that this banquet cannot begin at once. But we
should surely be interrupted by the colonel, and, on
the whole, I think it is best to wait until the colonel
has taken his departure for the night from that room,&mdash;which
I feel sure he will do, when the situation
dawns fully upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It also pains me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to be obliged to
invite you all to make yourselves uncomfortable in
that closet for a short time. At least, you will hear
all that is going on in the colonel&rsquo;s room, for the
partition is thin between that and his room. So you
will have to be careful and make no noise. I feel
quite certain that the colonel will make me a sudden
call soon after he retires, if not before, and he really
wouldn&rsquo;t approve of your being here. He&rsquo;s likely to
have a decidedly unpleasant way of showing his disapproval,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can assure our kind and thoughtful
host that we fully appreciate the situation,&rdquo; said Arthur
Warren, gravely, &ldquo;and will be pleased to comply with
his suggestion to withdraw. Come on, boys, let&rsquo;s get
in. It&rsquo;s after ten now, and time is getting short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the key with you,&rdquo; said Henry Burns,
&ldquo;and lock the door on the inside. It&rsquo;s just an extra
precaution; but I can say I don&rsquo;t know who has
the key, if anything happens. I won&rsquo;t know which
one of you takes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four boys stowed themselves away in the stuffy
closet, turned the key in the lock, and waited. Henry
Burns quickly divested himself of his clothing, put
a bowl of water beside his bed, placed a clean white
handkerchief near it, set a lamp near by on a chair,
turned it down so that it burned dim, unlocked his
door so that it could be opened readily, and jumped
into bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>He did not have long to wait. Promptly at a
quarter past ten o&rsquo;clock the heavy, lumbering steps
of the corpulent colonel were heard, as he came up
the hallway. The colonel was puffing with the exertion
which it always cost him to climb the stairs, and
muttering, as was his custom when anything displeased
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose they&rsquo;ll bang away on that old piano half
the night,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he passed Henry Burns&rsquo;s
door. &ldquo;And every light burning till midnight. How
do they expect me to make any money, if they go on
this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door to his room and went inside,
locking it after him. Henry Burns pressed his ear
close to the wall and listened.</p>
<p>The colonel, still talking angrily to himself, scratched
a match and lighted one of the lamps. Then he
divested himself of his collar and tie, threw his coat
and waistcoat on a chair, and reseated himself, to
take off his boots.</p>
<p>All at once they heard him utter a loud exclamation
of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter with that lamp?&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;That comes of having hired help from the
city. Never look after things, unless you keep right
after them. How many times have I spoken about
having these lamps filled every day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel scratched a match. &ldquo;Hulloa,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s full, after all. Well, I see, the wick
hasn&rsquo;t been trimmed. There&rsquo;s always something
wrong.&rdquo; The colonel proceeded to scrape the wick.
Then he scratched another match. The wick sputtered
as he held the match to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the thing!&rdquo; yelled the colonel, now
utterly out of temper. &ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s bewitched.
Where&rsquo;s that other lamp? Oh, there it is. We&rsquo;ll
see if that will burn. I&rsquo;ll discharge that housemaid
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scratched still another match, held it to the wick
of the other lamp, and was evidently satisfied with
that, for they heard him replace the lamp-chimney
and go on with his undressing.</p>
<p>In a few minutes more there came another eruption
from the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the other one,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I know
what&rsquo;s the matter. Somebody&rsquo;s been fooling with
those lamps. I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em smart for it.&rdquo; The colonel
unscrewed the part of the lamp containing the wick,
took the bowls of the lamps, one by one, over to his
window, opened them, and poured the contents of the
lamps out upon the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Water! That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
matter. Oh, but I&rsquo;d just like to know whether it&rsquo;s
that pale-faced Burns boy, or some of those other
young imps in the house. I&rsquo;ll find out. I&rsquo;ll make
somebody smart for this. Wasting my oil, too. I&rsquo;ll
make &rsquo;em pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel set down the lamps, rushed out of his
room into the hall for the lamp that usually occupied
a standard there. He did not find it, because Henry
Burns had taken the pains to remove it. The colonel
made a sudden dash for Henry Burns&rsquo;s door, rattled
the door-knob and pounded, and then, finding that in
his confusion he had failed to discover that it was
unlocked, hurled it open and burst into the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>What the colonel saw was the pale, calm face of
Henry Burns, peering out at him from the bed, as
that young gentleman lifted himself up on one elbow.
Around his forehead was bound the handkerchief,
which he had wetted in the bowl of water. The lamp
burning dimly completed the picture of his distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you there! You young&mdash;&rdquo; The colonel
checked himself abruptly, as Henry Burns slowly
raised himself up in bed and pressed one hand to his
forehead. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; roared the
colonel, completely taken aback by Henry Burns&rsquo;s
appearance.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;WHAT&rsquo;S THE MATTER WITH YOU?&rsquo; ROARED THE COLONEL&rdquo;" width="500" height="753" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHAT&rsquo;S THE MATTER WITH YOU?&rsquo; ROARED THE COLONEL&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, resignedly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel little realized how much of truthfulness
there was in this answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want me for anything?&rdquo; asked Henry
Burns, in his softest voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the colonel, sullenly. &ldquo;Somebody
has been fooling with my lamps, and I&mdash;I
thought I would use yours, if you didn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Henry Burns. &ldquo;I may not
need mine again for the rest of the night.&rdquo; Again he
pressed his hand dismally to his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo; snapped the colonel. &ldquo;You may
need it again. Why don&rsquo;t you tell Mrs. Carlin you&rsquo;ve
got a headache? She&rsquo;ll look after you. It&rsquo;s eating
too much&mdash;eating too much, that does it. I&rsquo;ve always
said it. Stop stuffing two pieces of pie every day at
dinner, and you won&rsquo;t have any headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this parting injunction, the irate colonel
abruptly took his departure, slamming the door behind
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Henry Burns dived beneath the bedclothes and
smothered his roars of laughter. The colonel, disappointed
in his quest for a lamp, and not caring to
search further in his present condition of undress,
returned once more to his room and finished undressing
in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make somebody smart for this to-morrow,&rdquo;
he kept repeating. &ldquo;Like as not that little white-faced
scamp in the next room had some hand in it. I
can&rsquo;t quite make him out. Well, I&rsquo;ll go to bed and
sleep over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel rolled into bed.</p>
<p>There was a crash and a howl of rage from the
colonel. He floundered about in a tangle of bedclothes
for a moment, filling the room with his angry
ejaculations, and endeavouring, helplessly, for a moment,
to extricate himself from his uncomfortable
position on the floor. Then he arose, raging like a
tempest, stumbling over a chair in his confusion, and
nearly sprawling on the floor again.</p>
<p>He rang the electric button in his room till the clerk
in the office thought the house was on fire, and came
running up, breathless, to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Who said there was any fire, you idiot!&rdquo;
shrieked the colonel, as his clerk dashed into the room
and ran plump into him. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any fire,&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s been breaking the furniture in
here; tearing down the beds, ruining the lamps. Get
that room on the next floor, down at the end of the
hall, ready for me. I can&rsquo;t stay here to-night. Don&rsquo;t
stand there, gaping like a frog. Hurry up. Get
Mrs. Carlin to fix that bed up for me. She&rsquo;s gone
to bed, do you say? Well, then, get somebody else.
Don&rsquo;t stand there. Go along!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The clerk hurried away, as much to prevent the
colonel seeing the broad grin on his face as to obey
orders. The colonel, stumbling around in the darkness,
managed to partly dress himself; and, five minutes
later, the boys heard him go storming along the
hall to the stairway, which he mounted, and was seen
no more that night.</p>
<p>The closet door in Henry Burns&rsquo;s room swung
softly open, and there rolled out helplessly on the
floor four boys, choking with suppressed laughter, the
tears fairly running down their cheeks.</p>
<p>Henry Burns, calm as ever, quietly arose from bed,
removed the bandage from his brow, slid into his
clothes, and remarked, softly, &ldquo;I feel better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Henry,&rdquo; begged George Warren. &ldquo;If
you say any more I shall die. I can&rsquo;t laugh now
without its hurting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need something to eat,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.
Pinning a blanket up over the transom to hide the
light, and stopping his keyhole, to prevent any ray of
light from penetrating into the hallway, and throwing
down a blanket at the door-sill for the same purpose,
Henry Burns lighted both his lamps, carefully locked
his door, and made ready to entertain his guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just according to the rules of etiquette,&rdquo;
he said, producing a package from the basket, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll have to start on the ice-cream first before it melts.
Then we&rsquo;ll work back along the line, to salad and
ginger ale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>He drew forth from the package, which proved to
be a box filled with chopped ice, a small brick of
ice-cream. It was beginning to melt about the edges,
but they made short work of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, &ldquo;if you please, we&rsquo;ll
start all over again. Here are the sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the finest spread I ever had,&rdquo; said young Joe,
appreciatively, as he stowed away his fourth sandwich
and helped himself to an orange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe always goes on the principle that he may be
cast away on a desert island before he has another
square meal,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;so he always fills up
accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good principle to go on,&rdquo; responded Henry
Burns. &ldquo;George, you open the ginger ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they dined most sumptuously, and had gotten
down to nuts and raisins, when Henry Burns, whose
ears were always on the alert, suddenly sprang up,
with a warning &ldquo;Sh-h-h,&rdquo; and, quickly stepping across
the room, turned the lamps down, signalling at the
same time for the boys to be silent.</p>
<p>Not one of the others had heard a sound; but now
they were aware that soft footsteps were pattering
along the hallway.</p>
<p>Presently some one came to Henry Burns&rsquo;s door,
turned the knob, and rapped very gently.</p>
<p>Not a sound came from the room.</p>
<p>Then a voice said: &ldquo;Henry, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; said the person outside; &ldquo;I could have
sworn that I heard his voice as I came up. Well, I
must have been mistaken. He seems to be sound
asleep. I guess his headache is better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>They heard the footsteps die away again along the
hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Henry Burns; &ldquo;that was a narrow
escape. That was Mrs. Carlin. Somebody must have
told her I was sick. She sleeps all night with one
eye and one ear open, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George Warren, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d
better take it as a warning that it&rsquo;s time to be going,
anyway. It&rsquo;s eleven o&rsquo;clock, I should say, and we
have got to get up early and overhaul the <i>Spray</i>.
She&rsquo;s up at Bryant&rsquo;s Cove yet, and we have got to
bring her down and have a new bowsprit put in, and
reeve some new rigging. We&rsquo;ve had a great time,
Henry. Count us in on the next feed, and give our
regards to Colonel Witham. Come on, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have to show you out the back way,&rdquo;
said Henry Burns, &ldquo;but the front way would be
dangerous now, and my lightning-rod staircase seems
to be the only way. It&rsquo;s a very nice way when one
is used to it; but look out and don&rsquo;t slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the last boy was on the roof, Henry
Burns was half-undressed; and by the time the last
one had reached the ground, his light was out and he
was half-asleep. That was Henry Burns&rsquo;s way. When
he did a thing, he did it and wasted no time&mdash;whether
it was working or playing or sleeping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A HIDDEN CAVE</span></h2>
<p>It was a little after eleven o&rsquo;clock when Tom left
the hotel. His mind was so occupied with the
events of the evening that he started at once
toward his camp, forgetting an intention he had earlier
in the night of visiting the locality of Jack Harvey&rsquo;s
camp in search of the missing box. He stopped every
few minutes to laugh long and heartily, as, one by
one, the mishaps of Colonel Witham came to his
mind.</p>
<p>All at once he remembered the missing box. He
had nearly reached his tent by this time, but he stopped
short. He called to mind the contents of the box;
among other things, a certain big cake, with frosting
on it, and, although he and Bob, as young athletes,
were bound to hold such food in little regard, there
was one thing about it which particularly impressed
him just now, and that was the remembrance of how
he had watched Bob&rsquo;s sister, with her dainty little
fingers, mould the frosting on the top, and how she
had slyly wondered&mdash;as if there could be any doubt
of it&mdash;whether they, meaning Tom, would think of
her while they were eating it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The thought of that cake falling into the hands
of Jack Harvey and of Tim Reardon and the others
of Harvey&rsquo;s crew, and of the jokes they would crack
at Tom&rsquo;s expense, made his blood boil. He started
in the direction of Harvey&rsquo;s camp, then turned back
to get Bob to accompany him,&mdash;and then paused and
went on again, saying to himself that he would not
awaken his chum at that hour of the night. He started
off through the woods alone.</p>
<p>The night was warm and pleasant, though it was
quite dark, as there was no moon. He passed by the
cottages, and then turned into a foot-path that followed
the windings of the shore. The path led for some
distance through a thicket of alders and underbrush,
from which at length it emerged into an open field.
Crossing this, Tom again entered a growth of wood,
the path winding among the roots of some old hemlocks
and cedars.</p>
<p>All at once he saw a light shining indistinctly
through the trees, and knew that it must be in the
immediate vicinity of Harvey&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better, if they are up,&rdquo; muttered
Tom. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re sitting around that fire they are
sure to be talking.&rdquo; He hurried on in the direction
of the light, still following the path.</p>
<p>The fire soon became plainly visible. At a point
where the path divided he could see the white tent,
lit up by a big fire of driftwood that blazed in front
of it. He could hear the sound of voices, and distinguished
that of Harvey above the others. There
seemed to be some insubordination in camp, for Harvey&rsquo;s
tones were loud and angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Tom concluded not to take the path to the left,
which was the one leading direct to the camp, but
continued on for a distance along the main path. It
was well he did so, for presently he heard some one
coming toward him. The paths were at this point so
near together that he could not distinguish which one
the person was taking; so he drew aside and crouched
in the bushes, which were very dense between the two
paths. A boy, whom he recognized as Tim Reardon,
soon came in sight, and passed close by the spot where
Tom was concealed. He carried a pail in his hand,
and was evidently going to a spring near by for water.
He was grumbling to himself as he passed along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always the one!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he
make some one else lug the water part of the time?
I&rsquo;m not going to be bullied by any Jack Harvey, and
he needn&rsquo;t think I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept on to the spring, however. Tom remained
where he was, and Tim soon returned, carrying the
pail filled with water. Tom waited till he saw Tim
arrive at the camp and deposit the pail of water near
the fire, before he again emerged from the clump of
bushes into the path that led past the camp. He followed
this cautiously. He could not as yet see whether
all the members of the crew were present about the
camp-fire, and he knew that to encounter any one of
them at that hour near the camp would not only put
an end to all hopes of recovering the box, by revealing
to Harvey and his crew that he suspected them
of having stolen it, but that, once an alarm being
given, he should have the whole crew at his heels in
a twinkling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Tom was sufficiently acquainted with the reputation
of Harvey&rsquo;s crew to know that it would go hard with
him if they found him there. He stole quietly along
past the camp some little distance, and then, turning
from the path, got down on his hands and knees and
crept toward the camp through the bushes.</p>
<p>Near the camp was a hemlock-tree, with large,
broad, heavy branches, that grew so low down on the
trunk that some of them rested on the ground. It
offered a place of concealment, and Tom, at the imminent
risk of being discovered, reached it and crawled
in between the branches. If the campers had been
expecting any one, and had been on the watch, he
must surely have been discovered, for several times
branches cracked under him, and once so loudly that
he thought it was all up with him, expecting them to
come and see what had made the noise. But they
took no notice of it, either because they were accustomed
to hearing noises in the woods, of cattle or
dogs, or thought nothing at all about it.</p>
<p>From where he now lay, Tom could see the entire
camp, and hear everything the boys said. It was a
picturesque spot which Harvey had chosen. The land
here ran out in one of those irregular points which
was characteristic of the shores of the island, and
ended in a little, low-lying bluff, that overlooked the
bay. On the side nearer the village, the shore curved
in with a graceful sweep, making a perfect bow, and
the land for some distance back sloped gradually down
to the beach. The beach here was composed of a fine
white sand, making an ideal landing-place for rowboats.
On the side farther from the village, the waterfront
was of a different character. It rounded out,
instead of curving in, and the shore was bold, instead
of sloping. It was not easily approached, even by
small boats, as the water, for some distance out, was
choked up with reefs and ledges, which were barely
covered at high tide, and at low water were exposed
here and there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>This apparently unapproachable shore had been
taken advantage of by Harvey in a way which no
one in the village had ever suspected. There was a
channel among the reefs, which a small sailboat could
pursue, if one were accurately acquainted with its
windings. With this channel, which they had discovered
by chance, the campers had become thoroughly
familiar, at both low and high water.</p>
<p>The point had been cleared of undergrowth, and
most of the larger trees had been cut down for some
little distance back from the water. In the rear of
this clearing there were thick woods, extending into
the island for a mile or more.</p>
<p>The campers had pitched a big canvas tent at the
edge of the clearing, where they lived in free and
easy fashion, cooking mostly out-of-doors. They
scorned the idea of making bunks, as smacking too
much of civilization, and at night slept on boughs
covered with blankets. They lived out-of-doors in
front of the tent when the weather was pleasant, and,
when it was stormy, they went aboard the yacht and
did their cooking in the cabin, over a small sheet-iron
stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>It was altogether a romantic and picturesque sight
that Tom saw as he looked out from his hiding-place.
At a little distance from the tent the fire was blazing,
while the members of the crew either sat around it
or lay, stretched out at full length, upon the ground.
A pot of coffee was placed on a flat stone by the side
of the fire, near enough to get the heat from it, and
the delicious odour of it as it steamed made Tom
hungry.</p>
<p>The members of Harvey&rsquo;s crew were utterly without
restraint, saving that which was imposed capriciously
by Harvey himself. Harvey was not naturally
vicious. His mind had been perverted by the books
he had read, so that he failed to see that his acts of
petty thievery were meannesses and acts of cowardice
of which he would some day be ashamed.</p>
<p>He fashioned his conduct as much according to the
books he read as possible, and, if he had been but
trained rightly, would have been proud to do courageous
things, instead of playing mean jokes, for he
had at heart much bravery. He rarely wore a hat,
and was as bronzed as any sailor. The sleeves of
his flannel blouse were usually rolled up to the elbows,
showing on his forearms several tattooed designs in
red and blue ink. He was large and strong.</p>
<p>The boys around the fire were telling stories and
relating in turn incidents of adventure that had taken
place since their arrival on the island. At the close
of their story-telling, they arose and began making
preparations for a meal. Near by the fireplace they
had built a rough table, of stakes driven into the
ground, and boards, with benches on either side of it,
fashioned in the same way. Two of the boys went
to the tent and brought out some tin dishes, and the
steaming pot of coffee was taken from the stone and
set on the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Then Joe Hinman, taking a long pole in his hand,
went to the fire and proceeded to scatter the brands
about, while a shower of sparks rose up and floated
off into the forest. Presently Joe raked from among
the embers a dozen or more black, shapeless objects.
These he placed one by one on a block of wood and
broke the clay&mdash;for such it was&mdash;with a hatchet.
The odour of cooked fish pervaded the camp and
saluted Tom&rsquo;s nostrils most temptingly. Inside of the
lumps of clay were fish of some kind, which Tom
took to be cunners. As fast as they were ready, Tim
Reardon carried them to the table, where they were
heaped up on a big earthen platter.</p>
<p>The boys then fell to and ate as though they were
starving. Tom wondered for some time if this could
be their usual hour for supper; but remembered that
he had seen the <i>Surprise</i> several miles off in the bay
that evening, and concluded that the evening meal
had been long delayed. The <i>Surprise</i> now lay a few
rods offshore, with a lantern hanging at her mast.</p>
<p>The boys continued to talk, as they ate, of tricks
they had played and of raids they had taken part in,
down the island. In fact, the good citizens of Southport
would have given a good deal for the secrets
Tom learned from his hiding-place that night. Tom
waited impatiently, however, for some mention of the
missing box. Could he be mistaken in suspecting them
of having taken it? No, he was sure not. That they
were capable of doing so, their own conversation left
no room for doubt. Tom felt certain the box was
in their possession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>But he began to feel that his errand of discovery
to-night would be fruitless. They must, he argued,
have some sort of storehouse, where they hid such
plunder as this, but no one had as yet made the
slightest mention of it. It was clearly useless for
him to grope about in the vicinity of the camp at night,
and he began to think it would be better after all
to wait until day and select a time for his search, if
possible, when all the members of the crew were off
on the yacht. But that might come too late, and Tom
wondered what to do.</p>
<p>All at once Joe Hinman made a remark that caused
Tom to raise himself upon his elbow and listen intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little surprise for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew, one and all, stopped eating, rested their
elbows on the table, and looked at Joe curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s a salmon from old Slade&rsquo;s nets,&rdquo; said
George Baker. &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s sworn for a week that he&rsquo;d
have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, is Joe,&rdquo; remarked Harvey, patronizingly.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one of you that can touch Joe
for smartness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Joe told how he had seen the box
that had been a part of Tom&rsquo;s and Bob&rsquo;s luggage left
on the wharf the night it arrived; how he had ascertained
that it contained food, by prying up the cover;
and how, early on the following morning, he had
rowed up under cover of the fog, and had brought
back the box to the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s down in the cave now,&rdquo; said Joe. Tom gave
a start. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a meat-pie in it that is good for
a dinner to-morrow, and a big frosted cake, if you
fellows want it to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Jack Harvey. &ldquo;You and I will
go and get it.&rdquo; Whereupon he and Joe sprang up
and made directly for the spot where Tom lay, passing
by so close that he could have reached out and
touched them, and hurried along the bank, down to
the shore.</p>
<p>Tom allowed them to get well in advance before he
ventured to crawl from his hiding-place and follow
them. He saw them at length disappear over the
bank at a point where there grew a thick clump of
cedars. He turned from the path into the woods,
made his way cautiously past the place where he had
seen them disappear, turned into the path again, and
then climbed down the bank, which was there very
steep, holding on to the bushes, and looked for the
boys, but they were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Tom knew they could not have passed him. They
had not reappeared over the edge of the bank, and
they were nowhere in sight along the shore. There
could be but one conclusion. The entrance to the
cave must be located in the clump of cedars.</p>
<p>It seemed to Tom that he had waited at least a
quarter of an hour, though, in fact, it was not more
than five minutes, when he saw the boys reappear.
Tom groaned as he saw the big cake in Joe&rsquo;s hand.
Joe laid it down on the ground, while he and Jack
picked up several armfuls of loose boughs lying about,
and threw them up carelessly against the bank. Then
Joe took up the cake again, and they emerged from
the cedars, climbed up over the bank, and disappeared
in the direction of their camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Tom lost no time in scrambling to the spot. The
hiding-place was cunningly concealed. It was an
awkward place to crawl to from any part of the
bank, and no one would have thought of trying to
land there in a boat. The entrance to the cave might
have been left open, with little chance of its ever being
discovered. Tom threw aside the boughs sufficiently
to discover that beneath them was a sort of trap-door,
made of pieces of board carelessly nailed together.
Then he replaced the boughs and, without even attempting
to lift the board door, regained the path at
the top of the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be time enough to explore that later,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the only one that will have
lost something out of that cave before morning,
though.&rdquo; He made his way cautiously past the camp
once more, and then started on a run for his own
camp. His hare and hounds practice at school stood
him in good stead, and he did not stop running till
he had come to the door of his tent. He unfastened
the flap and entered, panting for breath. Bob was
sleeping soundly. He shook him, but Bob was loath
to awake, and resented being so roughly disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Bob! Wake!&rdquo; cried Tom, shaking him
again.</p>
<p>Bob opened his eyes. &ldquo;Why, is it morning, Tom?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t, Bob, but it soon will be. I&rsquo;ve found
the box, Bob. Harvey&rsquo;s got it, and I know where it
is hidden,&mdash;down near his camp in a cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Bob shivered, for Tom had pulled the blanket off
the bed, and the moist sea air penetrated the tent. He
dressed, stupidly, for he was not fully rid of his
drowsiness.</p>
<p>The boys went down to the beach, and Bob washed
his face in the salt water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now, Tom, old fellow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but, honest, Tom, I feel ugly enough at being waked
up, not at you, though, to just enjoy a fight with
those fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little prospect of that, if we are careful,&rdquo;
answered Tom. &ldquo;What we want to do is to show
them we are smart enough to get the box back, and,
perhaps, play them a trick of our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they carried the canoe down to the shore,
launched it, and set off. It was about one o&rsquo;clock
in the morning. They paddled away from the tent
and down along the shore, noiselessly as Indians.
Past the village and past the cottages, and not a sign
of life anywhere, not even a wisp of smoke from
a chimney. The canoe glided swiftly along, making
the only ripples there were on the glassy surface of
the bay.</p>
<p>As they came to the beach near Harvey&rsquo;s camp,
they landed, and Tom crept up over the bank to
reconnoitre. He came back presently, reporting that
the crew were all sound asleep, and everything quiet
around the camp. Then they paddled quickly by the
end of the bluff and along the bold shore beyond,
picking their way carefully among the reefs, as they
could not have done in these unknown waters with
any other craft than the buoyant canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>They disembarked at the clump of cedars, and made
the canoe fast to the trunk of one that overhung the
water. Tom took from the bow of the canoe a lantern,
and they scrambled up the bank. Throwing
aside the boughs, they disclosed the trap-door, which
they lifted up. Tom lit the lantern and they entered
the cave.</p>
<p>They found it much larger than the opening indicated.
It was excavated from the hard clay of which
the bank was composed, and, though not high enough
for them to stand quite erect, it was about eight feet
long and five feet wide.</p>
<p>It was filled with stuff of all sorts. There were spare topsails
and staysails,&mdash;possibly from coasters
that had anchored in the harbour,&mdash;sets of oars from
ships&rsquo; boats, several boxes of canned goods, that the
grocer of the village had hunted for far and wide,
coils of rope, two shotguns, carefully wrapped in pieces
of flannel and well oiled, to prevent the rust from
eating them, four lanterns, two axes and a hatchet,
and odds and ends of all descriptions useful in and
about a camp or a yacht.</p>
<p>The roof of the cave was shored up with boards,
supported by joists. In one corner of the cave was
the box for which they sought, broken into, and with
the gorgeous cake gone; but that was all. The rest
of the contents were untouched.</p>
<p>They took the box, carried it down to the shore
and placed it in the canoe. Tom started to return to
the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now, Tom?&rdquo; queried
Bob. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to take anything of theirs, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t go in
for that sort of business, but I just want to show
them that we have been here and had the opportunity
to destroy anything that we were of a mind to. Perhaps
it will teach them a good lesson. It will show
them that we are as smart as they are, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Tom began to gather up the guns, the
good sails, the boxes of provisions, and other things
of value, and carry them outside the cave, setting
them down on the bank at some distance from the
mouth of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t destroy anything of value,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;But here are some odds and ends of old stuff, some
of these pieces of oars, empty crates, bagging, and
that sort of thing, which will make a good blaze, and
which would have to be thrown away some day. They
are of no use to anybody. I propose to make a bonfire
of these in the cave, just to show Jack Harvey that
we have been here. He&rsquo;ll find all his stuff that&rsquo;s
good for anything put carefully outside the cave, and
no harm come to it. But he&rsquo;ll be just as furious to
find his cave discovered and on fire, for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was thinking of that cake.</p>
<p>Tom took one of the axes and chopped a small hole
in the top of the cave, some distance above the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will make a draught,&rdquo; he said, in answer to
Bob&rsquo;s inquiry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Then he blew out the lantern and poured the oil
with which it was filled over the pile of rubbish. There
was still a small heap of stuff in one corner of the
cave, some old boards, and a few pieces of sail, thrown
carelessly in a pile, as though of no value. They did
not stop to bother with these, as they seemed of no
consequence, and they were in a hurry.</p>
<p>Tom struck a match and set fire to the heap that he
had accumulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get away from here any too soon, now,
Bob,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be some furious chaps out
here, when that fire gets to crackling and smoking.
We don&rsquo;t care to be about here at that time. They are
too many for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys scrambled down the bank, got into the
canoe, and pushed off. As they paddled away, the
light of the fire gleamed in the mouth of the cave. As
soon as they had gotten clear of the reefs, they did
not stop to reconnoitre the camp, but pushed by at
full speed. It was a race against fire&mdash;and they little
dreamed of its swiftness, nor of the hidden force which
they had let loose.</p>
<p>Along the shore they sped, speaking not a word
till they had got the village in sight and their arms
were cracking in the joints. Then they paused a
moment for breath, for their little craft was out of
sight of the camp now, in the dull morning light.</p>
<p>Tom, who had the stern paddle, had looked back
from time to time, but if there was any light to be
seen through the bushes it was very slight. The spot
was hidden now, too, by the intervening point of
land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I see a light or not,&rdquo; he
said. &rdquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of smoke, though, and I can
imagine, anyway, that I see a gleam of fire in the
midst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth before
he swung the canoe around with one quick sweep of
his paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Bob! Look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What have we
done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/pic1.jpg" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;LOOK, BOB! LOOK!&rsquo; HE CRIED. &lsquo;WHAT HAVE WE DONE?&rsquo;&ldquo;" width="500" height="759" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;&lsquo;LOOK, BOB! LOOK!&rsquo; HE CRIED. &lsquo;WHAT HAVE WE DONE?&rsquo;&ldquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>The sight that met their eyes was amazing.</p>
<p>A sheet of flame shot suddenly into the sky. It
looked like a tiny volcano, belching up fire and d&eacute;bris
and pushing up through the midst of it a great black
canopy of smoke. This was followed by the report
of an explosion that echoed and re&euml;choed through the
village, reverberating on the rocks across the harbour,
and filling the whole country around with its noise&mdash;at
once startling and terrifying. Then the light as
suddenly went out, a shower of burning sticks and
shreds of blazing canvas drifted lazily down through
the air, and a cloud of smoke hung over the spot.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob trembled like rushes. It seemed as
though every particle of strength had left them.
There could be but one conclusion. They had blown
up the camp. Harvey and all his crew were, perhaps,
killed.</p>
<p>Bob was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Tom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must get to camp
before we are seen. Brace up and try to paddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow or other they got to camp and dragged
the canoe ashore. They carried the box up to the tent
and locked it up in the big chest. Bob&rsquo;s hand trembled
so he could hardly put the key into the lock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Tom seated himself, dejectedly, on the edge of one
of the bunks, the picture of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I may as well go and give myself up
first as last,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to go to
jail, if they&rsquo;re killed. What can there have been in
the cave? I didn&rsquo;t see anything to explode, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Bob, &ldquo;unless it was something
over in that pile of stuff in one corner. I didn&rsquo;t examine
it, but they must have had something stored or
hidden underneath there, either kerosene or gunpowder.
By Jove! Tom, I remember now hearing
Captain Sam Curtis say he had missed a keg of blasting-powder
that he had bought for the Fourth of July,
and he said he thought some of the sailors down the
island had stolen it. That&rsquo;s where it went to; it was
hidden in that corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t help matters much, if they&rsquo;re all
dead,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be to blame, just the same.
Oh, Bob, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do,&rdquo; answered Bob, &ldquo;I stand my
share of it, just as much as you. I&rsquo;m just as guilty
as you are. But don&rsquo;t go to pieces that way, Tom.
We don&rsquo;t know yet whether they are hurt or not. The
best thing we can do is to get down there as quick
as ever we can. Shall we take the canoe and make
a race for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got
the strength,&mdash;and, to be honest, Bob, the courage.
It&rsquo;s taken every bit of strength and nerve out of me.
Bob, I tell you, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve killed them,&mdash;and
I, for one, don&rsquo;t dare to go and look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>And Tom hid his face in his hands, while the tears
trickled through his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re killed,&rdquo; said Bob, stoutly.
&ldquo;They were some distance away from the cave, you
know. Come, we&rsquo;ll go with the crowd, for the whole
town must be out by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he half-persuaded, half-dragged Tom away
from the tent, and they started for the hotel.</p>
<p>The explosion had, indeed, aroused every one.
Men were running to and fro, and the greatest excitement
prevailed. The news quickly spread that some
frightful accident had happened at Harvey&rsquo;s camp,
and Tom and Bob heard expressions of sympathy for
them on all sides, from many who had been the victims
of their tricks, and who had time and again
wished the island rid of them. A rumour spread
among the crowd of villagers&mdash;no one knew where it
originated&mdash;that a keg of powder, which the campers
had left to dry near the fire, had exploded, and blown
them all to pieces. This was only one of a number
of wild rumours that were noised about that morning
in the confusion and uncertainty. It was generally
believed that the crew must have been killed.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob hung on to the edge of the excited
crowd, which had assembled in front of the hotel,
and listened to these various expressions with horror.
Then, when the crowd moved on for the camp, they
followed, with sinking hearts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>It was a strange procession that went down along
the shore that morning. There were cottage-owners,
who had grievances against the crew; villagers, who
had been tormented and tricked by them time and
again; and fishermen, who had lost many a tide&rsquo;s
fishing, because their dories had been found sunk
alongside the wharf, with heaping loads of stones
aboard. Yet, now that disaster had befallen the crew,
they were one and all willing to condone the offences,
and anxious to render what help they could.</p>
<p>They went on rapidly. Tom and Bob soon heard
a cry from those in advance that the tent was still
standing. Then hope rose in Tom&rsquo;s heart, that spurred
him forward.</p>
<p>He dashed ahead, rushed past the leaders, cutting
through the woods where the path made a circuit.
There was the tent still standing, and apparently uninjured
by the storm of stones and d&eacute;bris that had
rained down about it. But the crew! Not the sound
of a voice was to be heard. Not a soul was stirring
anywhere in the locality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">JACK HARVEY INVESTIGATES</span></h2>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s heart sank as he approached the tent,
stepping over stones and fragments of wood
that lay all about. Pulling open the flap of the
tent, he looked anxiously inside. There lay the crew,
to a man, stretched upon the ground, motionless. A
sudden fear seized on Tom that the shock had killed
them as they lay sleeping, and he reeled and clutched
one of the guy-ropes to keep from falling.</p>
<p>The next minute the crowd of villagers had arrived,
and several heads were thrust inside the tent. Just
at that moment one of the crew slowly raised himself
on an elbow and said, angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this fuss about? Aren&rsquo;t you people
satisfied with trying to blow us up, without coming
around and making such a rumpus and keeping us
awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Jack Harvey. The others of the crew, taking
their cue from him, made a pretence of rousing
themselves up from sleep, yawned and rubbed their
eyes, and asked what was wanted.</p>
<p>Then, perceiving for the first time that there were
several stalwart fishermen in the party, and not daring
to go too far, Harvey added, in a sneering tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re obliged to you all for coming down
here. It wasn&rsquo;t curiosity on your part&mdash;of course
not. You came down because you thought we were
hurt, and we&rsquo;re much obliged to you. Of course we
are. We&rsquo;re glad to see you, moreover, now we&rsquo;re
awake. Wait a minute, and we will stir up the fire
and boil a pot of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was maddening to the rescuers. Some of the
fishermen suggested pitching in and giving the crew
a sound thrashing; but, so Squire Brackett said,
&ldquo;there was really no ground for such a proceeding,
though he, for one, would be more than glad to do
it.&rdquo; They could blame themselves for trying to help
a pack of young hyenas like these. For his part, he
was going back home to bed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll drown themselves
out in the bay if let alone,&rdquo; he commented.
However, he ventured the query to Harvey: &ldquo;Guess
you boys had a little powder stored around here, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess again, squire,&rdquo; answered Harvey, roughly.
&ldquo;Maybe we had a fort with cannon mounted on it,&mdash;and
maybe we&rsquo;d like to go to sleep again, if you
people would let us. We&rsquo;re not trespassing. We&rsquo;ve
got permission to camp here, so don&rsquo;t try to go bullying
us, squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the satisfaction, then, that the rescuers
got at the hands of the crew. They had come, burying
their grievances, and with hearts full of sympathy
and kindness for the unfortunate boys, and they
had encountered only the same reckless crew, that
mocked them for their pains. So they turned away
again, angry and disappointed, and nursing their
wrath for a day to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>And then, as the sound of the last of their footsteps
died away through the woods, Jack Harvey,
chuckling with vast satisfaction to himself, said:
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that fine, though? Wasn&rsquo;t old Brackett and
the others furious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe Hinman. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
think, after all, Jack, that it paid. We ought to
have treated them better, after they had come all the
way down here to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered Harvey. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go getting
squeamish, Joe. For my part, I&rsquo;m mad enough at
somebody to fight the whole village. There&rsquo;s our cave
that it took us weeks to dig, and hidden in the only
spot around here that couldn&rsquo;t be discovered, gone to
smash, with everything we had in it. Those two guns
that the governor bought me were worth a pretty
price, let me tell you. They must have gone clear
into the bay, for I can&rsquo;t even find a piece of the stock
of either one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as though somebody did discover
the cave, after all,&rdquo; said Joe Hinman. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
make me believe that it blew itself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Harvey&mdash;and then he
paused abruptly; for, of a sudden, there came sharply
to his mind the white face of Tom Harris, peering
in at the tent door, with a haggard, ghastly expression.
He recalled how Tom had started back and nearly
fallen at the sight of the crew lying still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the first one at the tent, too,&rdquo; muttered
Harvey to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Joe Hinman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;But you may be right,
Joe. You may be right, after all. Come, let&rsquo;s all go
out and look over the ground once more. There may
be a few things yet, to save from the wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explosion, strangely enough, had not injured
a single member of the crew. Not a piece of the
wreckage had struck the tent. Pieces of rock and
bits of branches and boards lay on every hand about
the camp, and a stone, torn from the bank, had crashed
down on the bowsprit of the <i>Surprise</i>, breaking it
short off, carrying away rigging and sails. There
was also a hole broken in the yacht&rsquo;s deck by a falling
piece of ledge.</p>
<p>The crew, awakened from sound slumber by the
awful crash and by the shower of earth and stones,
had rushed out, frightened half out of their wits,
and at an utter loss at first to know what had happened.
The full discovery of what had occurred only
served to deepen the mystery. How it had happened
no one could tell. To be sure, they knew what had
escaped the notice of Tom and Bob, that four lanterns
in a corner of the cave were filled with kerosene oil,
and that in another corner, in a hole under the floor,
covered with a few pieces of board and a thin sprinkling
of earth, were two kegs of blasting-powder.</p>
<p>It had been a narrow escape for them. A hole was
torn in the bank big enough to hold several yachts the
size of the <i>Surprise</i>. Not a vestige remained to show
that a cave had ever been dug there. Several boulders
had been dislodged from the bank and carried bodily
down to the water&rsquo;s edge, besides the one that had hit
the bowsprit of the <i>Surprise</i>. Of the stuff that Tom
and Bob had placed carefully outside the cave, not a
scrap remained. Every bit of it must have been blown
into the sea. But not a rock nor so much as a stick
had struck the tent. Beyond being dazed for some
moments by the shock of the explosion, not one of
the crew was hurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>When they had made a second and unavailing
search for anything that might have escaped the destruction,
and some half-hour after the villagers had
departed, the crew went back to the tent and laid
themselves down again for a morning&rsquo;s nap. They
were soon off to sleep, save one.</p>
<p>As often as he closed his eyes, Jack Harvey could
see, in his mind&rsquo;s eye, Tom Harris come again to the
door of the tent; and he could see him start back
and almost fall. Could Tom Harris have had anything
to do with the explosion? And if so, how? It hardly
seemed possible, but Harvey could not put the idea
out of his head. Tom&rsquo;s frightened face looked in at
him, in his troubled sleep that morning, and, long
before his crew were awake again and stirring, he
rose and stole out of the tent to the shore, where the
cave had been.</p>
<p>And so, while Tom and Bob rolled in on to their
bunks that morning, thankful in their hearts that no
harm had come to the crew, Jack Harvey was down
there by the shore, examining the ground over and
over again, every inch of it, from the place where
the entrance to the cave had been to the place where
the canoe had been made fast. Much of the bank
had been torn away there, but where the canoe had
been moored there was a spot for some few feet that
was undisturbed. Jack Harvey, after studying the
spot carefully, went back to camp. If he had found
anything that surprised him, he did not, for the
present, mention it to his crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Jack Harvey was a curious mixture of good and
bad qualities. His parents were wealthy, but uneducated
and unrefined. They allowed him to have all
the money he wished to spend, and permitted him to
do pretty much as he pleased about everything. Harvey&rsquo;s
father had been a miner, and had &ldquo;struck it
rich,&rdquo; after knocking about the California gold-fields
for nearly a score of years. Because he had managed
to get along well in the world without any education,
and without the influence of any restraint, such as
society imposes, he had a theory that it was the best
thing for a boy to work out his own upbringing. As
a consequence, his son was rarely thwarted in anything.
Left to himself, Harvey, though not naturally
bad, fell in with a rough, lawless class of boys, read
only the cheapest kind of books, which inspired him
to lead an idle, good-for-nothing life, and, as a result,
went wild.</p>
<p>He was strong and, among his associates, a leader.
They gladly awarded him this distinction, as they
were, for the most part, poor, and he spent his allowance
freely. He was captain of a ball nine, for which
he bought the uniforms and the necessary equipment;
captain of his yacht&rsquo;s crew, and, in all things,
their acknowledged leader. His companions came
generally to be known as Harvey&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Tom and Bob had a mere speaking acquaintance
with him, as they all attended the same school at home,&mdash;from
which, however, Harvey was more often
truant than present. Beyond that association they had
nothing to do with him. There were four members
of the yacht&rsquo;s crew, although that term was applied
by the people of the town to some dozen or more
boys. Of these four, Joe Hinman was a thin, hatchet-faced,
shrewd-looking boy, whose father was employed
by a railroad in some capacity that kept him
much away from home; George Baker and Allan
Harding were cousins, whose parents had a rather
doubtful reputation, as dealers in second-hand goods
and articles pawned, at a little shop in an obscure
quarter of the town. Tim Reardon had no parents
that he knew of, and earned an uncertain living, doing
chores and working at odd jobs through the winter.
In the summer, he was usually to be found aboard
Harvey&rsquo;s yacht, where he was fairly content to do
the drudgery, for the sake of the livelihood and the
fun of yachting and camping.</p>
<p>It was not the sort of companionship that a wise
and careful parent would have chosen for his son,
but they sufficed for Harvey, and no one interfered
with him. These boys did as he said, and that was
what he wanted.</p>
<p>Nearly every one in the entire village had gone
down to Harvey&rsquo;s camp in the next hour following
the explosion. Curiously enough, however, Henry
Burns was not of this number. He had jumped out
of bed at the crash and the shock, and had hastily
dressed and rushed down-stairs, ready to go with the
crowd. For once, however, Mrs. Carlin got ahead
of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Henry Burns,&rdquo; she had exclaimed, catching
sight of him as he dodged out of the door. &ldquo;Where
do you think you are going at this hour of the night,
and you that was feeling so bad only a few hours
ago. You&rsquo;re not going off through those woods
to-night, not if I know it. You can just take yourself
back to bed, if you don&rsquo;t want to be laid up with
a sick spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Henry Burns, now that attention was thus
publicly attracted to him, did not dare to steal out
later and join the others, lest Mrs. Carlin should hear
of it, and, perchance, become suspicious of him. So
he went back unwillingly to bed, but not to sleep.
He was wide-awake when the angry party returned.
Listening from his window, he heard their description
of the explosion and their impudent reception
by Harvey&rsquo;s crew; and proceeded to draw his own
conclusion from it all.</p>
<p>The more he thought of it, the more his suspicion
grew that, in some way, Tom or Bob, or both, had had
a hand in the thing. Tom, indeed, had expressed his
intention to Henry Burns of spying on the camp in
his hunt to find the missing box; and, although it
seemed a most unlikely hour for him to have gone
down there, Henry Burns wisely conjectured that that
was what he must have done.</p>
<p>Accordingly, shortly after Henry Burns had arisen
that morning, and after he had gathered from a few
villagers who were abroad some fuller details of the
night&rsquo;s adventures, he made his way to the camp on
the point. There were no signs of life about the
camp, and, softly opening the flap of the tent, he
peered within. Tom and Bob lay stretched out, sound
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Henry Burns stepped noiselessly inside. He called
them by name in a low tone, but they did not awaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night&rsquo;s excitement was too much for one of
them, at least, I guess,&rdquo; was his comment. And then
he added: &ldquo;If my suspicions are true, their fun lasted
later than mine, and was far more exciting&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll
find that out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a camp-stool beside each bunk, upon
which Tom and Bob had thrown their clothes before
turning in. Henry Burns quietly removed the clothing
from these chairs, made them into a bundle, and,
tucking the bundle under his arm, walked out of the
tent and lay down on the grass, just outside.</p>
<p>It seemed to him as though another hour had passed
before he heard a creaking of one of the bunks, and
a voice, which he recognized as Bob&rsquo;s, said: &ldquo;Hulloa,
there, Tom, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; growled Tom, sleepily, but made no
move.</p>
<p>Again Bob&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Say, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom&mdash;hulloa, old fellow&mdash;come, let&rsquo;s get up.
It&rsquo;s late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right, Bob, so it is.&rdquo; And Tom
roused up on an elbow and rubbed his eyes. Then
he gave a prodigious yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What a night I had
of it. I don&rsquo;t wonder we slept late, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; answered Bob. &ldquo;My! But I can
hear that explosion go off now, it seems to me. And
wasn&rsquo;t that an awful sight when the flame shot up
against the sky? I&rsquo;ll never forget it as long as I
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep our eyes on Harvey after this
for awhile,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
suddenly, as they tumbled out on to the floor. &ldquo;Where
are our clothes? We left them right here when we
turned in, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other and stared in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we did,&rdquo; answered Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; gasped Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope to die if I can guess,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain
enough, though, that some one has been in here while
we were asleep and cleaned out our wardrobe. Not
a thing left. You don&rsquo;t suppose that Harvey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; interrupted Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that young
scoundrel of a Joe Warren. He&rsquo;s always up to his
monkey-shines. It&rsquo;s some of his doings. He was the
one, mind you, that proposed yesterday that we carry
our change of good clothing up to his cottage for
safe-keeping. Here we are, now, without a rag to
put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he thinks we&rsquo;ll have to march up to his
cottage in blankets, like Indians,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Well,
if it comes to that, I&rsquo;ll stay right here till night. You
don&rsquo;t catch me parading around in a blanket in the
daytime, to be laughed at by everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to pay him up for this,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>At this moment Henry Burns appeared at the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have some cheap second-hand clothes here,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty well worn out, and you can
have them for a small consideration, seeing that you
need them so bad. I want the money for my poor
mother, who&rsquo;s sick at home with the smallpox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; yelled Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirate!&rdquo; muttered Bob.</p>
<p>They rushed fiercely at Henry Burns, who, however,
smiling serenely, still held on tightly to the
bundle of clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay me my price for them, and you can have
them all,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we try them on and see if they still fit,&rdquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My price,&rdquo; answered Henry Burns, depositing the
bundle on a chair and seating himself upon an end
of one of the bunks, &ldquo;is that you tell me how you
came so near to blowing up Jack Harvey&rsquo;s camp last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long shot on his part, but it went straight
to the mark. There was an awkward silence for
almost a minute. Finally Tom said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use trying to keep a secret from
him, Bob. He knows half already. We may as well
tell him all, and see what he thinks of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, Tom,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;No one was injured,
anyway, so no great harm can come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Tom related to Henry Burns the story of the
night&rsquo;s adventure. Henry listened with the greatest
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have given a good deal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see
Jack Harvey when he found his cave blown up, with
all their spoils along with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the story was finished, however, he was inclined
to treat the matter more seriously than they
had supposed he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a bad scrape to be in,&rdquo; he said at
length. &ldquo;From what I have heard about our friend
Harvey, I judge he is not one of the kind to let
a thing of this sort go without paying somebody back
for it. And I believe he is as sure to find out who
blew up that cave as I am that I am sitting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; replied Henry Burns; &ldquo;but if you
keep your eyes open, you will see that he suspects you.
I&rsquo;ll warrant if we could see Jack Harvey now, we
should see him out examining every inch of the shore,
looking at the rocks on the beach for any paint that
might be scraped off your canoe, and all such things as
that. He is a shrewd one, and, when he has once
satisfied himself that you and Tom wrecked his cave,
why, I wouldn&rsquo;t give a fig for your camp here,&mdash;that
is, unless you propose to stay at home all the
time to guard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say, if they could have seen Jack Harvey
just then, they would have witnessed a most startling
confirmation of Henry Burns&rsquo;s words. For Jack
Harvey, at that moment, was at the shore once more.
He was examining every inch of it. He was scrutinizing
every rock along the beach. He was out
among the ledges, looking carefully along their sides.
He was searching here, and he was searching there,&mdash;but
what he found he neither confided to his crew
nor to any one else, but kept locked for the present
in his own breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Henry is right,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;And it
isn&rsquo;t the most pleasant prospect to think that our
camp may be overhauled at any time, whenever we
happen to be away, and perhaps disappear altogether
some dark night, if we happen to be caught out on the
bay or down the island. But what to do I don&rsquo;t see,
for the life of me,&mdash;except to keep as quiet as possible
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not be right,&rdquo; suggested Henry Burns,
&ldquo;but my advice would be to do just the opposite,&mdash;that
is, when you once feel certain that Harvey is
hunting for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Harvey,&rdquo; continued Henry, &ldquo;that you blew
up his camp, and how you did it, and why. Tell him
what you saw in that cave. Ask him point-blank if he
would want the villagers to know what you saw in
there. Strike a bargain with him to call it even. He
will be glad to do it; whereas, if he finds you and
Bob out, without your knowing what he is up to, he
will watch night and day for a chance to harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; added Henry Burns, as he arose to
go, &ldquo;what with Jack Harvey and Colonel Witham
on the war-path after you, you are likely to have quite
a lively summer before you get through. So keep
your eyes open and look out. And remember, when
in trouble, always apply to H. A. Burns, care Colonel
Witham&mdash;always ready to serve you.&rdquo; And Henry
Burns walked away, whistling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Tom and Bob went about their breakfast preparations,
looking rather serious for a time; but a hearty
meal made them look at the matter somewhat less
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Burns is quite apt to be right about things,
so the Warrens say,&rdquo; commented Tom, after awhile,
as they were finishing their meal. &ldquo;But I guess he
likes to talk some, too, just to make an impression.
I don&rsquo;t see how Harvey can find out who blew up
his cave in a hundred years, if we only keep quiet and
don&rsquo;t give it away ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; answered Bob. &ldquo;Those things
do get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Harvey, in the meantime, having completed
a careful survey of the shore, and either finding or
not finding what he sought for, went back to his
camp and crew. Toward noon, however, he left his
camp, and a little later Tom saw him coming up along
the shore.</p>
<p>When he came to where the canoe lay on the beach,
Harvey paused and examined it closely. Then, as
though to test its weight, he lifted it up on his broad
shoulders, and then set it down on the beach again,
this time bottom up.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob started down to the shore at this,
but, before either they or Harvey had spoken, they
had seen plainly that which, perhaps, Harvey had
looked for, a long broad scratch upon the bottom of
the canoe, near the middle, where the fresh paint had
been scraped off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, there,&rdquo; said Harvey, as they approached.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine canoe you&rsquo;ve got there. Guess I&rsquo;ll
have to get the governor to buy me one. I saw your
tent yesterday, but didn&rsquo;t have a chance to come
around. You fellows got ahead of me, by coming
over last night&mdash;with the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Bob. &ldquo;We expected to find you
all blown into the sea. What was the matter over
at your camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, between you and me,&rdquo; replied Harvey, eying
them cautiously as he spoke, &ldquo;I think some one of the
crew did it, as a joke. They&rsquo;re up to that sort of
thing, you know. They&rsquo;d just as lieve do it as not,
any one of them. Like as not that young Tim Reardon
did it, because I make him lug water, and don&rsquo;t
let up on him when he has lazy spells. To tell you
the truth, we had a little powder stored away in a hole
under a tree, and I guess one of them touched it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey tried to speak carelessly; but there was
an angry light in his eyes and an expression around
his mouth which would not be concealed, and which
boded no good for somebody, and this was not lost
on Tom and Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up to the camp, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Tom.
Harvey first declined, as though it had not been his
intention to stop, and then accepted, and the three
went toward the tent. On the way there Tom found
a chance to say to Bob, &ldquo;I guess Henry Burns was
right, wasn&rsquo;t he, Bob?&rdquo; And Bob answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snug quarters you have here,&rdquo; said Harvey, as
they entered the tent. &ldquo;Tight and dry,&mdash;and bunks,
too. We can&rsquo;t beat these accommodations aboard the
<i>Surprise</i>. And here&rsquo;s camp-chairs, like a steam-yacht
or a cottage. You&rsquo;ll be having pictures on the walls
next, and a carpet on the floor,&mdash;and then you won&rsquo;t
allow each other to have mud on your boots.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Harvey was still watching them sharply as he spoke,
and may have made the last remark with a purpose,
inasmuch as the boots of both Tom and Bob were
begrimed and smeared with the clay from the bank
near Harvey&rsquo;s camp, and their clothes, for that matter,
were muddy in spots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; answered Tom, &ldquo;we have things
as shipshape as we can. We&rsquo;ve got a camp-kit here
that can&rsquo;t be beaten on the island. Maybe you would
be interested to have a look at it.&rdquo; So saying, Tom
deliberately unlocked the big packing-case and threw
back the cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Tom, pointing to the box that had
been stolen, &ldquo;what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey drew back quickly, and looked as though
he were about to strike Tom a blow, while his face
flushed angrily. Bob sprang quickly from his seat
on one of the bunks, and he and Tom stood
confronting Harvey. If the latter had intended to
strike a blow, he changed his mind and did not do it.
Instead, he gave a half-laugh and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I came up to see you about. The
fact is, I have known you fellows blew up our cave
ever since I saw your face&rdquo;&mdash;looking at Tom&mdash;&ldquo;at
the door of our tent last night. Then I found, too,
where your canoe had landed on the edge of the shore,
and just where that big scratch was made. The paint
is on the rocks yet. Now I don&rsquo;t think you fellows
used me square, though I know you did it because
you thought we stole your box&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you did,&rdquo; interrupted Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Again the quick flush in Harvey&rsquo;s face, and again
the gesture as though he would strike Tom a blow;
but he did not do it, as he had refrained before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s where you are wrong,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t deny that one of the crew took it,&mdash;not
knowing it was yours. They wouldn&rsquo;t one of
them take anything from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is not true,&rdquo; said Tom, quietly.</p>
<p>This was more than Harvey could stand. With
clenched fist, he rushed at Tom, aiming a heavy blow
at his face, and crying, as he did so: &ldquo;I lie, do I?
Then take that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom partially avoided the blow by stepping back
and guarding his face with one arm. The blow fell
short, striking him near the shoulder. At the same
time, however, he tripped over the packing-case, and
that, with the force of the blow, sent him over backwards,
so that he fell all in a heap in one corner of
the tent.</p>
<p>Harvey darted for the door, to make his escape;
but Bob sprang at him and the two clinched. Harvey
was larger and more than a match for either one of
them, and, with a quick twist, threw Bob violently
to the floor. But the latter clung to him and brought
him down, too. Then, before Harvey could break
Bob&rsquo;s hold, Tom had recovered himself and thrown
himself upon him. He rolled Harvey over, and the
next moment he and Bob had him securely pinned
to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Tom, as they held him fast, &ldquo;we are
not going to hurt you, Jack Harvey, because we are
no such cowards; but I&rsquo;ve got something to say to
you which it will be for your advantage to listen to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, let me tell you that you are a
coward and as good as a thief. You didn&rsquo;t steal our
box because one of your crew did it for you and
saved you the trouble; but you knew it was stolen
from us, and would have taken it yourself if you had
had the chance. You need not tell us that your crew
would not steal from us, for we know better, and so
do you. In the second place, I want to tell you that
we blew up your cave without intending to do more
than burn some of the things in it. The rest we took
out,&mdash;though it doesn&rsquo;t make much difference now
what our intentions were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, last of all, let me tell you that neither you
nor your crew are going to try to be revenged on us.
Why? Because you don&rsquo;t dare to. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
healthy for any of you, if it became known in the
village what was in that cave, and nobody knows that
better than you. Not that Bob and I intend to tell,
ever, unless you give us cause to. But let me tell
you that it won&rsquo;t do for you to play any tricks on us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t forget that neither you nor a single
one of your crew dares to disturb so much as a rope
around this camp. Now you can get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey rose, white with rage, and stood for a
moment, as though undecided whether or not to continue
the unequal combat; but his better judgment
prevailed, and he walked slowly out of the tent, pausing
at the door long enough to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not have any fear of our troubling you
or your camp. You have been too smart for us, and
we shall steer clear of you after this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he added, sneeringly, &ldquo;any little thing
we can do for you at any time, just let us know.
We shall think a great deal of two such smart fellows
as you, I assure you.&rdquo; And so saying, he left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry we can&rsquo;t say as much for you,&rdquo; Bob called
out after him, and was half-sorry for the words the
next moment; for it was foolish to increase an enmity
which could only lead to trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">SQUIRE BRACKETT&rsquo;S DOG</span></h2>
<p>The island got a respite of at least a week,
after the explosion, from excitement of any
sort. A calm like that of the primeval days
before the &ldquo;boom&rdquo; pervaded all the settlement. But
it was not to endure. One morning a little fishing-schooner,
which had fallen into the hands of Squire
Brackett, through a mortgage which he had foreclosed
upon a poor skipper across the bay, and which was
now lying at anchor in the harbour, was found painted
with broad stripes of blood red, and flying the skull
and cross-bones at the masthead, a veritable pirate
craft.</p>
<p>The squire was never able to discover whether the
authors of this piece of mischief were the boys or
some of his own townsmen, who, indignant at his
seizure of the only means of livelihood belonging to
the unfortunate skipper, had roundly denounced Squire
Brackett for his meanness. However, the incident
resulted in the squire leaving on the boat one day for
the city of Benton to make a purchase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>What the squire purchased he brought back with
him the next day. And, as it is a matter of passing
interest how his purchase arrived at the island and
how brief a time it remained there, it shall be here
recorded. By the same boat there came to the village
an individual whose arrival made no stir, but who
remained long enough to create the greatest excitement
the village had ever known.</p>
<p>The arrival of the steamer from Benton was an
event of great interest daily, for it brought not only
mysterious packages, bundles, and messages from
fathers whose business kept them in the city, but now
and then a new face, which was duly scrutinized and
commented upon by the summer colonists before its
possessor had crossed the gangplank.</p>
<p>So that on this day when Squire Brackett returned
to his native isle there were many gathered upon the
wharf, though, it is hardly necessary to say, not for
the purpose of welcoming his return. Yet one might
readily believe the squire thought otherwise; since, as
the steamer neared the wharf, this self-important individual,
arrayed in a suit of shining black, with a
great deal of staring shirt-front, and with an enormous
slouch-hat surmounting his ponderous head, seemed
the most conspicuous person aboard.</p>
<p>The squire stood nearest the gangway, and, indeed,
it looked from a distance as though the other passengers,
in recognition of the greatness of this island
magnate, had drawn respectfully back a little distance,
to wait till he should have gone ashore ere
they approached the railing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>As the steamer came nearer, however, the reason
for this seeming deference on their part became apparent.
It was plainly not due so much to any awe inspired
by the squire as it was to fear,&mdash;fear of the
squire&rsquo;s purchase. The squire&rsquo;s purchase was as ugly
and vicious looking a bulldog as ever walked on four
legs. The squire held the dog by a stout piece of
cord, which was wound several times about his wrist.</p>
<p>The dog and the squire, being each in equally ill-humour,
may have found their companionship agreeable.
Certain it was that the squire was the only
person whom the dog did not snarl and snap at. It
growled and snapped at every one, and even snarled
and showed its teeth at the good-natured cook aboard
the steamer, who had offered it a scrap of meat.</p>
<p>This surliness on the part of his new acquisition
had particularly pleased the squire, who argued from
it that here was an incorruptible beast, that would meet
in the same spirit any such advances upon the part
of strangers when it should be duly installed as guardian
of his farmhouse.</p>
<p>The squire would be magnanimous on this occasion,
however, and, despite the fact that the crowd on
the wharf looked to him, as it always did in his eyes,
like invaders of his domain, he gave a bow accompanied
by a sweeping gesture of his hand, presumably
intended to be a patronizing greeting, which
should include everybody, and nobody in particular,
at once.</p>
<p>Then the steamer made its landing. It was not
always an easy matter here, for the tide at certain
times ran swift, and seemed to strive fiercely to drive
the boat away from the wharf. Therefore, when the
steamer was as yet at some distance from the wharf,
a deck-hand at the bow skilfully let fly a coil of small
rope, which unwound in the air and was caught by
a man standing on the wharf. To an end of this rope
was attached the usual heavy hawser, which was then
drawn on to the wharf by means of the small rope,
and the bight thrown over a spiling. In like manner
the other big hawser was drawn up astern on to the
wharf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>When things were done shipshape, it was the rule
of the steamer that the small rope should be coiled
again and at once thrown back to the boat while one
end was still fast to the wharf, so that when the
hawser was cast off from the spiling it could be drawn
aboard by the small rope, without its splashing down
into the water and getting wet.</p>
<p>But things were more often done hurriedly than shipshape
at the Southport landing. The steamer&rsquo;s crew
had all they could do usually to land freight and get
it out quickly enough, so that the boat could go on
down the bay without losing time. The line thrown
to the wharf was usually caught by the village storekeeper,
who had little time to spare, or by whatever
man or boy happened to be standing near at hand.
The boat&rsquo;s rule was seldom obeyed. Scarcely any one
ever took the trouble to coil up the small rope and
throw it back. When the hawsers were cast off they
fell into the water, regardless of the fact that they
thereby got wet and became heavier, dragging the
small ropes after them, and were hauled aboard as
the boat steamed away.</p>
<p>The steamer having, on this occasion, been made
fast to the wharf and the gangplank put out, Squire
Brackett crossed it, dragging his purchase behind
him,&mdash;the purchase skulking very unwillingly across
the plank and showing its teeth at the crowd upon
the wharf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>The squire hated and despised boys, and made it a
point to ignore them whenever it was possible. For
this very reason they delighted to annoy him by hailing
him whenever they met him. Young Joe Warren
had a way of driving the squire nearly into fits by
pretending to mistake him for one Captain Kendrick,
who was the bitterest enemy the squire had, and then
always apologizing for his mistake by explaining to
the squire that he could not tell them apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Squire Brackett, glad to see you
back again!&rdquo; cried Henry Burns, in the heartiest
fashion imaginable, as the squire stepped on to the
wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Morning&mdash;morning,&rdquo; grunted the
squire, as he eyed Henry Burns suspiciously.</p>
<p>Henry Burns smiled most affably, as though the
squire had been his dearest friend and adviser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you do, squire?&rdquo; said George
Warren, cordially.</p>
<p>Squire Brackett scowled angrily at him, but answered,
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; as short as he could.</p>
<p>Just then young Joe made his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Captain Kendrick?&rdquo; he bawled,
loud enough to be heard all over the wharf.</p>
<p>The crowd began to smile, and young Joe added,
hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon, Squire Brackett&mdash;always take
you for Cap&rsquo;n Kendrick&mdash;strange how you do look
so much alike.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You little idiot,&rdquo; yelled the choleric squire, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
Cap&rsquo;n Kendrick you with a rawhide, if I had the
say of you,&mdash;insulting an honest man with a name
like that,&mdash;every one of you ought to be in State
prison. And you, you&rsquo;re the worst one of all, Jack Harvey,&rdquo;
pointing to the latter, who had just come upon
the wharf. &ldquo;And you, too!&rdquo; shaking his fist at
Tom and Bob. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sly, but you&rsquo;ll get caught yet.
You&rsquo;re a pack of young rascals, every one of you.
Don&rsquo;t any of you come around my house, if you don&rsquo;t
want to be chewed up. Here, you brute! Quit that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;&lsquo;YOU&rsquo;RE THE WORST ONE OF ALL, JACK HARVEY&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>The dog had snapped viciously at a child that ran
past, causing her to scream with fear.</p>
<p>Just then the freight-agent called out to the squire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come in here and see about this
freight of yours,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all mixed up. And
don&rsquo;t bring that dog in here, or the crew may take
him for a piece of freight and run a truck against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one corner of the freight-house on the wharf
was a big iron ring, to which the squire tied the dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t advise anybody to meddle with him,&rdquo;
he said; but the advice seemed hardly necessary, for
the dog showed its teeth and sprang savagely at any
one who ventured to come near.</p>
<p>There were some expressions of indignation that
such a dangerous brute should be brought to the
island.</p>
<p>Every one did keep as far out of the dog&rsquo;s way
as possible, excepting Tim Reardon, who, after a
whispered consultation with Jack Harvey, after which
the latter disappeared behind the freight-house, seated
himself just out of the dog&rsquo;s reach, and caused that
animal to froth at the mouth and nearly strangle itself
in trying to get loose, by pointing a finger at the dog
and making a loud hissing noise between his teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Not content with this form of annoyance, Tim
Reardon varied it now and again by darting a hand
out at the dog, as though in an attempt to seize him
by the throat. To which the maddened animal, with
true bulldog ferocity, responded with savage rushes
as far as the rope would permit, his wide-open jaws
fairly dripping with rage and disappointment.</p>
<p>If there was any design on the boy&rsquo;s part to distract
the dog&rsquo;s attention from what Jack Harvey was
doing at the corner of the freight-house, to which the
dog was tied, it succeeded admirably. Moreover, it
is certain that, when Harvey reappeared, Tim stopped
teasing the brute, and he and Harvey walked around
to the rear of the freight-house.</p>
<p>The freight-house was situated almost at the end of
the wharf on its seaward side, so near to the edge
of the wharf that there was only room for a single
person to walk along on the outside, and that at the
risk of losing one&rsquo;s balance and falling off the wharf.
The ring to which the dog was tied was on the side
near the end, and was not visible to those standing
on the front of the wharf. Any one going around
to the further side of the freight-house at this moment
might have seen Harvey and Tim standing there,&mdash;Harvey
nearest the ring and holding a knife in his
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The steamer in landing had made a complete circuit
in the harbour, and had come alongside the wharf
with her head pointing out into the bay, so that now,
as Captain Chase called out &ldquo;All aboard,&rdquo; and gave
orders to cast off bow and stern lines, the boat was
ready to steam directly away from the wharf. The
gangplanks were drawn in. There was a tinkling of
bells; a great commotion as the steamer&rsquo;s wheels
began to revolve rapidly; a general waving of handkerchiefs
from the wharf to those who were bound
farther down the bay; the steamer began to glide
away from the wharf, when suddenly somebody
shrieked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog! The dog! Run! Run! He&rsquo;s broken
loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before the crowd had time to scatter, the dog,
infuriated with the tormenting it had received at the
hands of Tim Reardon, dashed toward it. Men,
women, and children fled in terror. Squire Brackett,
who came running out of the freight-house, did not
dare face the dog, but dodged back into the freight-house
and slammed the door shut, in a cold sweat of
fear.</p>
<p>The boys, most of them, rushed for points of safety,
clambering up the ends of the spiling that jutted above
the floor of the wharf, and young Joe and Tom Harris,
being at the very edge of the wharf, and having no
other means of escape, and nothing to defend themselves
with, dropped off the wharf into the water and
swam to shore. Several of the other boys and some
men scrambled about for clubs to ward off the brute&rsquo;s
fierce rush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Among these latter was Henry Burns. Realizing
on the instant that to attempt to flee was worse than
hopeless, he had glanced about for something to defend
himself with, and had seized upon a broken piece of
oar. Grasping it with both hands, he stood, calmly
awaiting the attack. The dog, seeing him right in
his path, rushed at him, and when within a yard of
the boy suddenly gave a spring, as though to seize
him by the throat.</p>
<p>Henry Burns, summoning all his strength, aimed a
terrific sweeping blow at the dog, but it missed its
mark. Meeting no obstruction, the force of the blow
swung the boy completely around, so that he lost his
balance and fell sprawling upon the wharf, while the
piece of oar flew from his hands and landed far out
in the water.</p>
<p>A strange thing had happened. The crowd, pausing
breathlessly in the midst of flight, had seen with
horror the dog spring at Henry Burns; but the animal&rsquo;s
leap had a most extraordinary termination. All
at once the dog was jerked violently backward through
the air, and fell heavily on the wharf, yelping with
surprise and fright. Then it was dragged rapidly
across the wharf, and the crowd yelled with derision
as they saw that the rope by which the dog had been
tied to the ring had been unfastened or cut from the
ring, and had been fastened to the rope which had
been thrown from the steamer, and the other end of
which was made fast to the steamer&rsquo;s hawser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>As the boat steamed away it drew the rope after it.
There was no possible escape for the dog. Struggling
as best it could, barking and yelping, and snapping
madly at the rope, it braced itself for one instant on the
edge of the wharf, and then was dragged over and fell,
still struggling, to the water below. The steamer kept
on its way a short distance, and then stopped. The
rope was drawn in by a deck-hand and the dog hauled
to the railing of the steamer, but it was not taken
aboard, for nobody on board wanted a dead dog. The
deck-hand cut the rope, and the body splashed into
the water.</p>
<p>Thus perished the squire&rsquo;s bulldog, unmourned,
save for the squire himself, who raged about the
wharf, looking for some boy whom he might accuse
of the trick, and vowing untold vengeance upon the
perpetrators of it. But, one and all, they had wisely
dispersed, the guilty and the innocent alike, and the
squire was soon left alone in his wrath.</p>
<p>Who had done the thing? The crowd did not
know, for it had been too excited to notice that Jack
Harvey and Tim Reardon had emerged from behind
the freight-house just at the critical moment when the
dog had sprung at Henry Burns.</p>
<p>As for Henry Burns, he was the hero of the hour.</p>
<p>There had been on the whole so much excitement
attending the squire&rsquo;s arrival that few had noticed
a stranger who had come ashore soon after Squire
Brackett. He had not waited on the wharf, but had
gone directly to the hotel. There Henry Burns met
him later; for the man sat at Colonel Witham&rsquo;s table,
as that was the only one then available.</p>
<p>The new arrival was the sort of guest to please the
colonel, for he was extremely quiet. He walked only
with the aid of a cane, and then, apparently, with
great effort, stopping frequently to rest. He told
them he had been very ill; that his health had broken
down with overwork, and he had accordingly tried
cruising along the coast. His friends had left him
up the river some days before, and would call for
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>He was a man a little under middle age, of medium
height and thick-set, with black hair and a pale,
smooth-shaven face. He was evidently somewhat a
man of the world and had travelled abroad, for, seated
before the fireplace in the office that evening, he talked
for some time of his travels.</p>
<p>But there were other things of more interest to the
boarders than this quiet, reserved stranger, who did
not play cards and who hobbled about with a cane.
There was, above all, a morning paper from town,
which bristled with startling head-lines, descriptive
of a robbery of the residence of one of the richest
men in the town. It told how the thieves, three in
number, had entered the house where Mr. Curtis, the
owner, was sleeping alone, in the absence of his family;
how they had put a pistol to his head and made him
get up and open a safe, from which they had taken
several hundred dollars in money and a jewel-case
containing a diamond necklace and other gems to the
value of several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The jewels, it said, were the property of Mrs. Curtis,
and most of them had been bridal presents. A
reward of $500 was offered for their return or for
information leading to the arrest of any one of the
robbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>The article stated further that Mr. Curtis was positive
he could identify the man who subsequently
bound and gagged him, his mask having but partially
concealed his face. He was, he said, a man of about
medium height, with black hair, black moustache, and
heavy black beard, broad-shouldered, thick-set, and
unusually active and powerful.</p>
<p>All this, as it was read aloud, threw the guests into
the greatest possible excitement, as a great part of
them were from the very town and knew the Curtis
family, by reputation if not personally.</p>
<p>It did not, of course, interest the stranger guest,
for he nodded in his chair and nearly dozed off several
times during the reading. Still, when the guests had
dispersed, he picked up the paper from a chair and
took it with him to his room.</p>
<p>It was the very next night following that of his
arrival that Henry Burns met with a surprise.</p>
<p>On the night in question there was a full moon
about half-past ten o&rsquo;clock, and, as Henry had agreed
with Tom and Bob to meet them at their tent, he
opened his window, stepped out on to the ledge and
started to climb to the roof.</p>
<p>Mackerel had struck in at the western bay, and
the boys had planned to paddle down the island that
night, carry their canoe across the short strip of land
that saved the island from being cut into almost equal
halves by the sea, launch it again in the western bay,
and paddle around to where the Warren boys&rsquo; sloop
lay anchored in Fish Hawk&rsquo;s Cove. Then they were
all to try for mackerel early in the morning.</p>
<p>Henry Burns stepped softly out, grasped the lightning-rod,
and, with a quickness that would have
amazed the worthy Mrs. Carlin, scrambled to the ledge
over the top of his window. There he paused a
moment for breath, and then climbed up the lightning-rod,
hand over hand, and gained the roof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>He had proceeded then across the roof but a little
ways, when he heard suddenly, almost directly beneath
him, the sound of footsteps. Some one was coming
up the stairs that led to the roof.</p>
<p>Henry Burns had barely time to conceal himself
behind a chimney when the trap-door in the roof was
softly opened, and he saw the head and shoulders of
a man emerge through the opening. Henry Burns lay
flat on the roof, in the dark shadow cast by the chimney.
The moon shone full in the man&rsquo;s face, and
Henry Burns saw, to his amazement, that it was the
stranger guest. The sickly, weak expression in the
man&rsquo;s face was gone, and in its stead there was a
sinister, bold look, which seemed far more natural
to his powerful physique.</p>
<p>Suddenly the man, with the strength and ease of an
athlete, sprang lightly out on to the roof. He still
carried his cane, but he had no use for it, save to clutch
it in one hand more after the manner of a cudgel
than a cane.</p>
<p>Henry Burns, for once in his life, was afraid. It
was all so strange and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Once upon the roof, the man straightened himself
up, threw out his chest and squared back his broad
shoulders. He was erect in stature, without the suggestion
of a stoop. He seemed to exult in the freedom
of the place, like one who had been kept in some
confinement. When he walked across the roof to the
edge facing the sea, there was no suggestion of any
limp in his gait. It was quick and firm, but noiseless
and almost catlike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>What did it mean? Henry Burns thought of the
robbery. Could the man have had anything to do
with that? Why had he pretended to be weak and
ill? Why had he come to this out-of-the-way place,
pretending that he was an invalid? Surely he could
have no designs upon any one on the island. There
was no house there that offered inducement to a
robber, if the man were one.</p>
<p>It must be that his coming was an attempt to hide
himself away&mdash;to secrete himself. But why? The
description of the robber that had bound Mr. Curtis&mdash;did
that tally with the appearance of this man?
Broad shoulders, medium height, active, powerful,&mdash;all
these agreed. But the black moustache and heavy
beard. The stranger&rsquo;s face was smoothly shaven.
That transformation, however, could have been quickly
effected.</p>
<p>One thing was certain. It would not be well that
this man, a pretended invalid, but strong, and armed
with a heavy cane, that had suddenly become transformed
from a cripple&rsquo;s staff to a cudgel, who could
but have some dark motive in thus disguising and
secreting himself, should find himself watched and his
secret discovered. Henry Burns crouched closer in
the shadow of the chimney, and hardly dared to
breathe. The evil that he had so accidentally uncovered
in the man, his own helplessness compared
with the other&rsquo;s strength, and the dangerous situation,
there upon the house-top, made him afraid. If they
had been upon the ground he would have feared less.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>The man scanned the moonlit waters of the bay
long and earnestly. His survey done, he paced a few
times back and forth, swinging the cane, and then,
stealing noiselessly to the doorway, disappeared down
the stairs, closing the trap-door after him.</p>
<p>Henry Burns lost little time in descending to the
ground. On the way to the boys&rsquo; camp that night
he made two resolves: first, that he would keep to
himself, for the present, at least, the stranger&rsquo;s secret;
second, that, whatever that secret was, he would find
it out if any clue was to be had upon that island. The
second resolution, he thought, rather included the first,
since, the greater the number of those who knew of
the stranger&rsquo;s secret, the greater the chances of his
suspicions being aroused.</p>
<p>Another thing that disturbed Henry Burns not a
little was the knowledge that his excursions over the
roof were now attended with greater risk than ever.
It would not do to encounter the stranger there unexpectedly.
What might not the man, suddenly
aroused, and desperate, as Henry Burns believed him
to be, do to him, if he found himself discovered? A
fall from such a height must mean instant death, and
who was there to suspect that he had not fallen, if
he should be found next day lying upon the ground?</p>
<p>In the future he must know whether the roof were
occupied or not before he ventured upon it, and especially
must he be careful when returning late at night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Henry Burns resolved to keep the man&rsquo;s secret for
a time, for the reason that he was firmly convinced
he had not come to the island to commit any wrong
there, but to hide away. The island offered every
advantage for the latter, and no inducement for the
former. The man&rsquo;s design certainly was to secrete
himself. Still, Henry Burns had no intention of letting
the man escape from the island. He would watch
also for those friends that the man had said were
to come for him with their yacht, and he would make
sure that they did not sail away again. Though but
a boy, the stranger&rsquo;s secret was in dangerous hands,
if he had but known it. And yet luck was to effect
more than Henry Burns&rsquo;s scheming.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob were waiting impatiently when Henry
Burns arrived at the tent. They launched the canoe,
the three embarked, and soon left the tent and
then the village behind. They glided swiftly along the
picturesque shore till they came at length to the narrows;
here they carried the canoe across and launched
it again in the western bay. In an hour from the
time they had left the tent, they had come alongside
the sloop <i>Spray</i> in Fish Hawk&rsquo;s Cove, and the Warren
boys had sleepily made room for them in the cabin.</p>
<p>It was crowded for them all there, and it may have
been for that reason that Henry Burns did not sleep
soundly,&mdash;either that, or because of the figure of a
man that he could not drive from his mind, and that
appeared to him, half-dreaming and half-awake, as a
figure that hobbled along, stooping and bent, but
which suddenly sprang up before him, lithe and threatening,
and brandishing in his hand a cudgel that
looked like a cane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE HAUNTED HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock next morning, when Arthur
Warren tried to rouse the other boys, they
were loath to turn out. It was warm inside,
under the blankets, and the sea air outside was cool
and damp. Out in the cockpit Arthur lighted an oil-stove,
which they always carried aboard, made the
coffee in a big pot, and set it on to boil. Then he
called the sleepers in the cabin again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come you, Art, shut up out there! How do you
expect any one can sleep, with you bawling out in that
fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was from George Warren, whose voice denoted
that he was only about half-awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want you to sleep any more,&rdquo; answered
Arthur. &ldquo;Want you to get up and fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care to fish,&rdquo; said George, still only half-awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; persisted Arthur, &ldquo;may I inquire what
you did come over here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you may. I came over here to sleep. I
like the air over here. Now, please don&rsquo;t disturb us
any more, Arthur. You can be decent, you know,
when you&rsquo;ve a mind to be.&rdquo; And with this request,
drowsily mumbled, George pulled the blanket comfortably
about him and settled back for another nap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>At this juncture, however, his brother poked his
head in at the companionway and yelled at the top of
his lungs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, there! Hulloa, I say! There&rsquo;s a school
of mackerel breaking off the point. Wake up, every
lazy lubber aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Art, you&rsquo;re a mean scoundrel,&rdquo; said George
Warren, emerging once more from the blankets.
&ldquo;You know there isn&rsquo;t a mackerel in sight. I&rsquo;ll be
just fool enough to look out of the window, though,
so you can laugh, so get ready.&rdquo; And George looked
sleepily out of the little cabin window.</p>
<p>He had no sooner done so, however, than he sprang
up, exclaiming, excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are, sure enough. Boys, get up! Get
up! There&rsquo;s a school of mackerel breaking off the
point, as sure as we&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys needed no further urging. They dressed
and scrambled out on deck. Not far away from the
sloop could be seen plainly that tiny chop-sea which
is caused by the breaking of a school of mackerel.
The calm surface of the water was broken there by
a series of miniature ripples which could not be mistaken.
The fish were there, but would they bite?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming this way,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;We
can soon reach them with the throw-bait. We shall
not have to leave the sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily they got the bait out. It was a bucket filled
with scraps of fish and clams, chopped fine and mixed
with salt water. Taking a long-handled dipper,
Arthur half-filled it with the bait and threw it as far as
he could out toward the school of fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The mackerel seized upon it greedily. From the
sloop the boys could see them dart through the water
after it as it slowly sank. The water was fairly alive
with fish, ravenously hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Arthur. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hungry as
sharks. Get the lines out, quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a twinkling every boy had a line overboard; but,
to their disappointment, not a fish would bite. They
still seized the throw-bait that was cast out, but not
one of them would take a baited hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t a regular mackerel trick, I&rsquo;ll eat my
bait,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Sam said mackerel
would often act that way, though I never saw
them when they wouldn&rsquo;t bite before. He says they
will play around a boat for hours and not touch a
hook, and, all of a sudden, they&rsquo;ll commence and bite
as though they were starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s words were unexpectedly verified at this
moment by a sudden twitch at his line and by corresponding
twitches at all the other lines. The fish had
begun biting in earnest. The next moment the boys
had three or four aboard, handsome fellows, striped
green and black, changing to a bluish shade, and soon
the cockpit seemed alive with them.</p>
<p>It was new sport for Tom and Bob, but they soon
learned to tend two lines, one in each hand; to drop
one and haul the other in at a bite, and to slat
the mackerel off the hook with a quick snap, instead
of stopping to take them off by hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The mackerel bit fiercely, sometimes at the bare hook
even, like fish gone crazy. It seemed as though they
might go on catching them all day long, for the water
was alive with them; but all at once the fish stopped
biting as abruptly as they had begun. They still
played around the boat, but not a fish would touch a
hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well put up our lines, boys. They are
through biting for this morning,&rdquo; said Arthur Warren.
&ldquo;Besides, we have more fish now than we know what
to do with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no doubt of that. They had caught
several hundred of the fish&mdash;enough to supply the
village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make friends with every one in town,&rdquo; said
George Warren. &ldquo;These are the first mackerel of the
season, and we will give away all we cannot use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as though I could eat about four now,&rdquo;
said young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can eat at least six,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try you and see,&rdquo; said Arthur, producing
an enormous frying-pan from a locker and a junk of
pork from another. &ldquo;Tom, you&rsquo;re the boss cook
of the crowd. You fry the fish while the rest of us
clean up the boat, make things shipshape, and get
ready to sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; said Tom, rolling up his sleeves.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, four apiece is how many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And soon the appetizing odour of the frying fish,
mingled with that of the steaming coffee, saluted most
temptingly the nostrils of the six hungry boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>It was several hours after this, when the yacht was
bowling along in the western bay, near the head of
the island, before a fresh southerly breeze, that young
Joe said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how we can play a stupendous joke on
everybody in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe being the youngest of the brothers, and of the
party, and it being therefore necessary that he should
be occasionally squelched, George merely said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think of anything, Joe, but playing
jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; retorted Joe, &ldquo;seeing you are all so
wildly enthusiastic, I&rsquo;ll just keep it to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Joe, don&rsquo;t be huffy,&rdquo; said Arthur, whose
curiosity was aroused. &ldquo;Tell us what it is, and if
it is any good we&rsquo;ll try it, won&rsquo;t we, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There being an unanimously affirmative reply,
young Joe proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no risk at all about this.
You know the old farmhouse on the bluff across the
cove? Everybody in the village believes it is haunted.
I found that out yesterday, when I was in Cap&rsquo;n Sam&rsquo;s
store. The house hasn&rsquo;t been lived in for two years,
and not a soul in the village has dared to go near
it at night in all that time. If any of them had to
stay over there all night, they would sleep out in the
woods rather than go into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, the house belonged to a man by the name
of Randall, Captain Randall, who lived there with his
wife. This was a little more than two years ago. He
owned a little fishing-smack, in which he went short
trips down the coast. One night in a storm he drove
in on to the bluff; the smack was pounded to pieces,
and he was drowned. His wife died not long after.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, the villagers have thought the house
haunted. They hear shrieks from there during the
night, and think they see strange lights in the windows.
They were discussing it in the store yesterday. Cap&rsquo;n
Sam declared that, only a few nights ago, when he
was coming across the cove from Billy Cook&rsquo;s, he
saw the ghost of Captain Randall pass out of the
back door of the old house and disappear in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy Cook, who lives up the cove, was in the
store, too. He said he and his wife hear screams
come from there often in the night, especially when
it is storming; and two other villagers said they had
seen lights in the windows long after midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That new boarder at Colonel Witham&rsquo;s was in
there, too, Henry. He said he knew houses were
haunted, and told several stories about ghosts, which
he said were true. But I believe he knew they were
lies, and he was only amusing himself; but that&rsquo;s
nothing to do with the matter. The villagers seemed
to believe all that he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what I propose is, that we manufacture
some brand-new ghosts for them, some they have
never seen before. There are some red and green
lights up at the cottage, that were left over from the
Fourth of July, which we can burn inside the house,
after letting out a few screeches that will arouse the
village. Then we&rsquo;ll wrap sheets around us and run
past the windows, while the lights are burning. We&rsquo;ll
have something wrapped in white to fling off the cliff,
too, in a flare of light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll run down through the woods and take
everything with us. And if we don&rsquo;t have some fun
the next day listening to the ghost-stories about the
village, why, my name isn&rsquo;t Joe, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not such a bad scheme, Joe,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a daisy,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, &ldquo;and easily done.
What&rsquo;s to hinder our going up there to-night and
taking up the lights and the sheets and looking the
place over? I never was inside the old house myself,
though I have been close to it at night, and never saw
or heard of any ghosts. We can carry a lantern up
with us and light it after we get inside. If any one
sees the light from the village he will think it&rsquo;s the
ghosts walking again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like so much of this running around in
the night,&rdquo; said Tom, flexing his biceps. &ldquo;A fellow
must have sleep to keep in condition, but I guess they
can count on us in this case, can&rsquo;t they, Bob? It&rsquo;s
too good to be missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;We can turn in and
sleep this afternoon. Count me in, for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;suppose we all start from
our cottage at ten o&rsquo;clock to-night. We&rsquo;ll launch the
rowboat from the beach and slip across and look
things over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was agreed.</p>
<p>The yacht had long turned the head of the island
and was beating down alongshore in the eastern bay.
Presently they rounded the bluff and came into the
cove. It was nearly noon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>High up on the bluff, and several rods back from
the edge of the cliffs, was the old farmhouse; it stood
out conspicuously, though at some distance from the
water-front, for the land rose quite sharply and the
house occupied the top of the eminence. Around it,
on all sides except that facing the village, was a dark,
heavy growth of hemlocks and pines. It was a mysterious,
shadowy place, even by day; but when darkness
set in about it, standing off solitary and alone,
as it did, from the rest of the village, with the waters
lying between, it is little wonder that superstition inhabited
it with ghosts and that it was a spot to be
shunned.</p>
<p>At the outermost end of the cliffs that protruded
into the bay, a ravine, where the ledge at some time
had been rent apart, led from the water up toward the
cottage, affording a precarious pathway. There was
a natural stairway of rock for some distance from the
water&rsquo;s edge, and at the end nearest the old house a
series of clumsy wooden stairs led up from the ravine
to the surface of the bluff. These were now old and
rather rickety; but a light person, at some risk, could
still use them.</p>
<p>The villagers, as a rule, avoided the house and this
pathway to the bluff. If they had occasion to go
ashore there, they usually landed farther up the cove
at a beach, and walked through the woods at a distance
from the house. No one cared to go very
near it.</p>
<p>When the sloop had come to anchor in the cove
opposite the Warren cottage, the boys took a boatload
of mackerel ashore, besides a basketful in the
canoe. They carried them around to every cottage
in the village, and even to the hotel, though, as George
Warren remarked, they would have to get Colonel
Witham out of bed some night in a hurry to make
up for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Certainly the village, supping that night on their
catch, was inclined to forget and forgive them
many a prank that had been stored up for future
punishment.</p>
<p>When Henry Burns made his exit across the roof
that night, he made a careful survey before climbing
out on it to see that the stranger was not there. There
were no signs of him, and Henry got away safely.
Tom and Bob were at the Warren cottage when he
arrived. Everything was in readiness, and they all
set out for the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These clouds in the sky are favourable,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;If it was as bright as it was last night, we
might have to postpone our trip. This mackerel sky,
through which the moon shines dimly, is just the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be favourable,&rdquo; added
George, as they hurried down the bank to the beach.</p>
<p>And yet not quite everything, for, when they had
reached the shore and came to look for the boat, it
was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; cried young Joe. &ldquo;And we left
it here at five o&rsquo;clock, too, after washing it out thoroughly,
because we had brought the mackerel ashore
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have stolen it?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Nobody ever has a boat
stolen in this harbour. Some one who wanted to
cross the cove has borrowed it. We shall find it all
right in the morning,&mdash;but that don&rsquo;t help us out
now. It&rsquo;s provoking enough, and strange, too, after
all, that the one who took it didn&rsquo;t step up to the
cottage and let us know, as the cottage is so near.
But boats are almost common property here; any man
in the harbour would lend us his boat in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do the next best thing,&rdquo; said Arthur,
&ldquo;and take one from the slip at the wharf. No one
will want his boat at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though some one does seem to want ours,&rdquo; broke
in Joe. &ldquo;Curious, isn&rsquo;t it, that whoever it is should
come around into the cove and get our boat, when
there are any number at the slip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly was rather strange.</p>
<p>Following Arthur&rsquo;s suggestion, the boys proceeded
to the slip and embarked in a big dory, the property
of Captain Sam. Then they rowed quickly across the
cove.</p>
<p>It took them but a few minutes to reach the other
shore, for the cove was smooth as glass. They headed
for the bluff, and pointed directly into the black,
shadowy hole which they knew to be the natural landing-place.
It was a peculiar, narrow little dock, completely
rock-bound, except for the passage leading into
it. It lay entirely in the shadow, but they had landed
there before, and knew just where to steer for a
shelf, or ledge, of rock that made a natural slip.</p>
<p>Still, their familiarity with the place did not prevent
them from bumping suddenly into a rowboat that
lay moored there. They pushed it aside to make a
landing, and found to their amazement that it was
their own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; cried George, springing out on to the
broad, shelving ledge; &ldquo;that is queerer still. Here&rsquo;s
the old <i>Anna</i>, and what in the world is she doing
here? Who can have brought her? And what for?
There&rsquo;s something strange about it. Why, there isn&rsquo;t
a man in the village that would dare go near the
haunted house at night, and yet somebody is over
here now, for some reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it were possible for Henry Burns to be excited
ever, he was so now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in here, quick, George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
make any noise. I think I know what it means, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you just as soon as we get out of here. We
can&rsquo;t get away any too soon, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take the <i>Anna</i> out with us?&rdquo; said young
Joe, &ldquo;and pay somebody off for running away with it?
He would only have to walk a few miles around the
cove to get back again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, leave the boat where it is,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns. &ldquo;And let&rsquo;s get out of here quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Henry?&rdquo; asked
George, jumping back into the boat and giving it a
vigorous shove off. &ldquo;Any one would think to see
you that some one was being murdered up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns&rsquo;s earnestness was sufficient to convince
them, however, that something serious was involved
in their actions, and they made haste to get
out into the cove again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Row for the beach above, boys,&rdquo; continued Henry
Burns, &ldquo;and we will go up to the old house through
the woods. I think I know who is up there in the
house, and if I am right it means that we may make
an important discovery. The man who I think is up
there is Mr. Kemble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! The cripple?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is another one of Henry Burns&rsquo;s jokes,&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having lots of fun with us, aren&rsquo;t
you, Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I am in earnest,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t burn any lights to-night, and you
better make up your mind to that, right off. There&rsquo;s
more serious business ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, when they had landed on the beach and
had drawn the boat noiselessly up on the shore, Henry
Burns told them of the adventure he had had on the
roof of the hotel. How he had seen the stranger throw
off his disguise of weakness, and become, suddenly, a
man of strength and action; how he believed the man
to be somehow connected with the thieves who had
committed the robbery, and how he believed that the
man was now up there in the haunted house, though
for what purpose he could not tell. It might be he
had something to conceal there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracky!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, when Henry Burns
had finished his story. &ldquo;This beats ghost hunting all
hollow; but we are by no means certain that it is
this stranger who is up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I believe as Henry does, that it is he,&rdquo;
said George Warren. &ldquo;Who else would have any
object in being up there this hour of the night? We
know from what Henry saw that the man is dangerous,
that he seems to be in hiding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that if he should catch one of us spying on
him up there in the old house, he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to
shoot,&rdquo; interrupted young Joe, who would rather have
risked the meeting with a legion of ghosts than with
one real live thief, armed and desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; answered Henry Burns;
&ldquo;but we must not give him that opportunity, if it
is he, which, of course, we&rsquo;re by no means sure of.
At any rate, we want to see and not be seen by whoever
is there, and we cannot go any too quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the tide was rising, and they might be
gone some time, they lifted the dory and carried it
up out of the reach of high water, after which
they began the ascent of the hill. There was not a
breath of wind stirring, and there was not a sound
of life in the woods. The tide crept in softly, and
not even a wave could be heard on the shore.</p>
<p>Out through the trees they could see, as they
climbed, glimpses of the water, calm and placid as
a mill-pond, lit up dimly by the moonlight shining
through a patchwork of clouds that covered all the
sky. Beyond this the darkness of the village was
accentuated by a light here and there, glimmering
from the window of some cottage.</p>
<p>Then they came to the brow of the hill, and could
see the haunted house through the trees. They approached
cautiously. It looked gloomier than ever,
with its sagging, moss-grown roof, its shattered window-panes,
and the door in the side hanging awry
from a single hinge.</p>
<p>In what once had been the dooryard there were a
few straggling clumps of bushes, and thistles and
burdocks grew in rank profusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>It was a sight to dampen the ardour of stouter
hunters than this band of boys. But when, added to
all this, there suddenly flashed across one of the windows
a ray of light, faint and flickering, but discernible
to them all, and which the next instant disappeared,
they halted irresolutely and debated what they
should do.</p>
<p>It was finally determined that Henry Burns and
Bob White should go on ahead to the old house, while
the rest waited at a little distance till they should
reconnoitre. The two set off at once, while the others
waited behind a clump of trees. They did not have
to wait long, for the two returned shortly, telling them
to come on softly. When within a few rods of the
house they dropped on their hands and knees and
crept along.</p>
<p>All at once the two ahead stopped and whispered
to the others to listen. They heard noises that seemed
to come from the cellar, which sounded as though
some one was digging in the earth. Then, as they
came within range of a long, shallow cellar window,
they saw the rays of a lantern.</p>
<p>They crept up closely and peered in through the
pane. There, in the damp, dingy, cobwebbed cellar
of the haunted house, dimly lighted by the rays of
a lantern, which stood on an old wooden bench, a
man was working. He had his coat off and was
digging in the ground with a spade, throwing up
shovelfuls of the hard clay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>The rays of light from the lantern were not diffused
evenly throughout the cellar, but shot out in
one direction, toward the spot where the man was
at work; and this because it was neither the ordinary
ship&rsquo;s lantern, nor yet a house lantern, but a small
dark lantern, such as a burglar might carry on his
person, with a sliding shutter in front.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s sleeves were rolled up, displaying arms
that were corded with muscle, and on which the veins
stood out as he worked. He handled the spade awkwardly
enough, but made up in strength for his lack
of skill. Presently he paused and looked up, and they
saw that it was, as Henry Burns had prophesied, the
stranger guest.</p>
<p>A curious occupation for one who was cruising for
his health! Indeed, he looked so little like a man
that was weak and ill, and so much like one that
was powerful and reckless and devoid of fear, as the
light of the lantern caused his figure to stand out in
relief against the darkness, that, though they were
six and he but one, had he seen them and sprung up,
they would have fled in terror.</p>
<p>Then, as he stooped down to grasp the lantern, they
drew quickly back from the window. It was well they
did so, for, taking up the lantern, the man flashed it
upon the window-panes, and then, turning it in all
directions, threw the rays of light in all parts of the
cellar and out through a window opposite. Then he
set it down again; and it was evident his suspicions
had not been aroused, for he resumed his digging.</p>
<p>After a few minutes he threw down the spade and
produced from the darkness a small tin box, which
they had not seen before, which he deposited in the
hole he had dug. Then he shovelled the earth back
upon it, stamping it in with his feet, and so refilled
the hole. The remaining loose earth he scattered about
the cellar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The boys waited no longer, but crept back to the
edge of the woods. In a few minutes they saw a
faint flash of light through one of the windows in
the floor above, and presently they saw the man come
out of the door in the front of the house. He had
extinguished the lantern and was still carrying the
spade. As he walked quickly down the path to the
landing-place, he left the path and hid the spade beneath
some underbrush, after which he disappeared
over the edge of the cliff. Finally they saw him
out in the middle of the cove, pulling vigorously for
the other shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, as they watched him
out of sight, &ldquo;there are lots of sick men whom I
would rather meet over here in the night-time than
that same Mr. Kemble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as strong as a lion,&rdquo; said young Joe. &ldquo;Did
you see the veins stand out on his arms as he worked?
I felt like making for the woods every time he
straightened himself up, with that spade in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of us felt any too comfortable,&rdquo;
said Tom, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;m sure I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid
to meet him in the daytime, with Bob and one of the
rest of us. It&rsquo;s the influence of the night-time that
frightened us. And he seemed to be right in his
element in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dig that box up and get away from here
and discuss the matter afterward,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
getting late, and we don&rsquo;t want mother to worry.
I&rsquo;ll get the spade.&rdquo; And he ran and brought it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>They went into the haunted house then, groping
their way in the darkness, for they had left their own
lantern in the dory. They made their way to the
kitchen and found the cellar door, with some difficulty.
Then, lest the old stairs should be unsafe, they
went down one at a time.</p>
<p>It was an easy matter to unearth the box, though
they worked in utter darkness. When they had secured
it, they refilled the hole and then stamped the
earth down as they had found it. This being done,
they were glad enough to get away from the house, to
replace the spade beneath the underbrush, where the
man had hidden it, and hurry down to the shore.
Launching the dory, they embarked, Henry Burns
carrying the box, and, with George and Arthur Warren
at the oars, they had soon crossed the cove and
landed on the beach.</p>
<p>There, too, was the <i>Anna</i>, drawn high up on shore,
where the stranger had left it. It was a large and
heavy boat, and it must have required enormous
strength in one man to drag it there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">SETTING A TRAP</span></h2>
<p>When the boys had at length gathered around
the table in the old-fashioned kitchen of the
Warren cottage and had drawn the window-shades,
they proceeded to examine the box. It was
an ordinary shallow tin box, such as a business man
might keep odds and ends of papers and cash in. It
was fastened with a small padlock. After trying to
unlock this with every key they could find in the
house, and without success, young Joe produced a
file, and with this filed through the small staple in the
box.</p>
<p>When the cover was thrown back there was disclosed
a layer of fine cotton, like jewellers&rsquo; cotton,
and when this was lifted out there came from the box
a myriad of tiny flashes of light. The inside of the
box was fairly ablaze. Countless little flashes of light
danced and twinkled there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried George Warren. &ldquo;We have the
stolen jewels, and no mistake. Just see how these
sparkle.&rdquo; And he lifted up a necklace of diamonds,
that blazed in the light of the lamp like a ring of fire.
They sparkled and gleamed like little stars, as the
boys passed them from hand to hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; cried a pleasant voice, all of a
sudden; and Mrs. Warren, who had been awakened
by the sound of their voices and had hastily dressed,
entered the kitchen. &ldquo;Is this den the cave of the
forty thieves?&rdquo; she asked, smiling, and then, as she
caught sight of the glittering gems, she exclaimed,
anxiously: &ldquo;Why, boys, what on earth does all this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means, mother,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;that Henry
Burns has done what the detectives have been trying
to do ever since the robbery at Benton. Here are
the stolen diamonds, and Henry will take them to
town to-morrow and claim the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only on one condition,&rdquo; interrupted Henry Burns.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t stir one step to secure the reward until it
is agreed that it shall be evenly divided between us
all. You fellows have just as much claim upon it
as I, and, unless every one of you solemnly swears to
take his share, I shall never take one cent of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And every one of them knew that he meant exactly
what he said.</p>
<p>Early next morning Henry Burns and George Warren
stood upon the wharf, awaiting the arrival of
the boat for Mayville. The boat connected there with
a train that would arrive in Benton during the forenoon.
Henry Burns carried in one hand a small
satchel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hard work to persuade old Witham to let
me go,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t see what
I wanted to go poking off to Benton for. Said I
better stay here and save my money. As it is, I&rsquo;ve
got to go and call on an aged aunt of Mrs. Carlin and
spend the night there. Well, I guess I can manage
to amuse myself, even there. I&rsquo;m likely to see a few
other people before I get back, eh, George?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know one man who won&rsquo;t turn you out-of-doors,
when you produce those diamonds,&rdquo; answered
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
lose sight of this stranger, although I almost know
he won&rsquo;t attempt to leave the island for several days.
I remember that yesterday he got a letter, and I have
no doubt it was from his confederates, saying when
they would arrive. They are coming in a sailboat,
for he has said so. Now, if they were coming to-night
or to-morrow, he would not have hidden that
box over there in the old house. You may be sure
he did not expect them for a day or two,&mdash;but
still you boys must keep him in sight, for one never
knows what is going to happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he goes over to the bluff, you know what to
do. You must get Captain Sam, the constable, to
have him arrested at once. By to-morrow night I&rsquo;ll
be back with everything arranged to capture the whole
three. I think you and I will see lively times around
this harbour before many days are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak of the evil one and he appears,&rdquo; said George
Warren. &ldquo;And, as true as I live, here comes Mr.
Kemble. You do the talking, Henry, for I feel as
though I should give him cause for suspicion if I said
a single word to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; replied Henry Burns. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
playing a bold game, and so must we;&rdquo; and, as the
stranger guest hobbled down to the wharf, groaning
and wincing, as though racked with pain, Henry
Burns gave him a cheery greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Kemble,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I see
you&rsquo;re out bright and early. I declare, you have
begun to look better already than you did the night
you arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very miserable&mdash;very miserable,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Kemble, most dejectedly. &ldquo;My rheumatism
is something awful. I&rsquo;d give everything I
possess in the world if I could run around and be as
active as you young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, I&rsquo;m sure, in a few days,&rdquo; answered
Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the man, turning upon Henry
Bums sharply, while a strange look, that he could not
conceal, stole over his face.</p>
<p>George Warren turned away precipitately, and,
taking a fishing-reel from his pocket, dropped a line
over the side of the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something peculiar in this island air,&rdquo;
continued Henry Burns, looking Mr. Kemble full in
the eye, with the most innocent expression on his
face. &ldquo;No matter how bad a person feels when he
first comes here, it puts new life into him. The first
thing he knows he begins to feel like rowing boats,
and going fishing, and all that sort of thing. I come
here sick every summer, and I go away feeling strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Kemble, uneasily, but looking
relieved, &ldquo;I hope it may do as much for me. If it
does, I&rsquo;ll buy a cottage here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find any cottages to sell, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
said Henry Burns. &ldquo;But there are several old farmhouses
that could be bought cheap, and they make
over as good as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;m not looking for old farmhouses,&rdquo;
said Mr. Kemble, gruffly; and then, as the whistle
of the boat sounded suddenly from behind the bluff,
he added, &ldquo;But I must be getting back to the hotel.
I&rsquo;m not feeling well to-day, at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any errand I can do for you in the city?&rdquo; Henry
Burns called after him.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kemble was hobbling away as fast as he
could, and did not heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy he would feel worse if he could see what
I&rsquo;ve got in this satchel,&rdquo; chuckled Henry Burns, as
Mr. Kemble went on toward the hotel, somewhat
faster than he had come down. &ldquo;Did you notice
how suddenly he had to leave when he heard the boat&rsquo;s
whistle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;but what on earth were you thinking of,
Henry, talking as you did to him?&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;It
scared him in an instant when you told him he would
be running around in a few days as lively as any
of us. I almost believe he half-suspects something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he?&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Perhaps my
remark about his running around in a few days may
have startled him at first. That was a sudden jolt
to his guilty conscience. But, upon reflection, he
decided it was only a coincidence. Then he did look
a little queer when I spoke of farmhouses, didn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly did,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;What possessed
you to do it? You might upset everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Henry Burns. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t suspect
us. By the way, do you remember how we got
into this thing in the beginning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I remember rightly,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, speaking
with a slight drawl, &ldquo;we started out last evening
to have some fun. My little chat with our friend is
the nearest approach to fun that this scrape has afforded
me so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may have been fun for you,&rdquo; said George.
&ldquo;To my mind it was very much like playing with
fire; but here&rsquo;s the steamer. You&rsquo;ve got my note of
introduction to father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got everything all right. Now keep
your eyes open and expect me to-morrow night.&rdquo; And
Henry Burns crossed the gangplank to the steamer.</p>
<p>The train from Mayville to Benton reached its destination
at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and at that hour in the forenoon
Henry Burns walked briskly out of the station.
Half an hour later he stood in the waiting-room at
the wealthy banking-house of Curtis &amp; Earle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want, young man?&rdquo; asked an
important and decidedly officious attendant, bustling
up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Curtis, I presume,&rdquo; answered Henry
Burns, blandly, but with the faintest suspicion of a
twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the man, abruptly, and looking
a little foolish as several other attendants tittered
audibly. &ldquo;And, what&rsquo;s more, you cannot see Mr.
Curtis, for he is just preparing to leave for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I must see him,&rdquo; insisted Henry Burns. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got some very important information for him. Have
the kindness to take this in to him,&rdquo; and he handed
the surprised attendant a card upon which he had
written in a clear but boyish hand:</p>
<div class="nbox">
<p class="center"><i>Henry Allen Burns
<br /><span class="small">Private Detective</span></i></p>
</div>
<p>The attendant took the card, read it with a grin,
looked at the boy, as if puzzled what to make of him,
shrugged his shoulders and left the room. Presently
he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Curtis would be greatly obliged if you would
call to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is going out of town
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see him at once,&rdquo; said Henry Burns,
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible&mdash;&rdquo; but at this moment the door of
the banker&rsquo;s private office opened, and a voice said:
&ldquo;Show Mr. Burns in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns entered. He saw before him a tall,
well-built man, smooth shaven, with black, piercing
eyes, and a firm, decisive mouth. He had on his hat
and gloves, and carried a light coat on his arm, as
though about to leave his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will oblige me by stating your business as
quickly as possible, young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I am
about to take a train out of the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see by your card,&rdquo; he continued, gravely, &ldquo;that
you are a private detective. I suppose you are aware
that I am a busy man, engaged in important affairs,
and have no time in office hours for pleasantries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had said an amateur detective I should have
been more correct, sir, since this is my first case,&rdquo;
answered Henry Burns, calmly. &ldquo;It is so very
curious, however, that I feel certain it cannot fail to
interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will you tell me why it should interest me, and
not keep me waiting?&rdquo; exclaimed the banker, in a
tone of impatience. Evidently he did not for a moment
connect the boyish figure before him with any
possible recovery of his lost jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Henry Burns, speaking deliberately.
&ldquo;Last night some other boys and I watched
a man bury a small tin box in the cellar of a deserted
house. When the man went away we dug it up. I
have the box here; would you like to see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns calmly opened the satchel.</p>
<p>But the banker sprang up from the chair in which
he had seated himself, and exclaimed, excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;let me see it&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns passed him the box, and with nervous
fingers the banker broke the twine with which the
boys had secured it. The next instant he had drawn
the necklace from the box and held it up, while his
hands trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Alice&rsquo;s diamonds, as I hope to live,&rdquo; he
cried, unmindful of Henry Burns&rsquo;s presence for the
moment. &ldquo;And the rings and the brooch&mdash;everything&mdash;everything
is here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the best detectives in this
country are working on the case, but I had already
begun to despair of ever seeing the jewels again. They
are exceedingly valuable, but, besides that, as they
were wedding presents to my wife from me, we both
prize them far beyond their real worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But be seated. I shall postpone my trip out of
town, you may be sure. And now let me hear the story
of your discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the calm, graphic manner characteristic of him,
Henry Burns told the story of the night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed the banker, as the boy concluded.
&ldquo;You have indeed acted as efficiently as the
best detective could have done. We are bound to
capture the robbers. Burton must know of this at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang for an attendant, and, after writing a note,
dispatched him with it. At the expiration of about
half an hour the attendant returned, and ushered into
the room a man of medium height, of light complexion,
with steel-blue eyes, and a face that impressed
Henry Burns at once as denoting great daring and
coolness. The banker introduced him as Mr. Miles
Burton, of a secret detective bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a young man, Burton,&rdquo; said the banker,
smiling, &ldquo;who, I take it, has some inclinations for
your line of work. In fact, here is pretty convincing
proof of it.&rdquo; And the banker pointed to the box of
jewels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Mr. Miles Burton looked nonplussed. He stared
at the box in amazement for a minute, and gave a low
whistle. Then he laughed and said: &ldquo;I have always
maintained that luck is a great factor in detective
service, though I am ready to give a man his due
for a good piece of work. In either case, you have
my congratulations, young man, for a half a thousand
dollars is just as good whether it comes by luck or
shrewdness, or both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective listened with the keenest attention as
Henry Burns repeated the story he had told the banker.
He made him give the minutest details of Mr. Kemble&rsquo;s
personality, at the same time suggesting features
which Henry Burns corroborated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I thought from the start, and just as
I told you, Mr. Curtis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The man is undoubtedly
George Craigie, who is known among his
class as the &lsquo;Actor,&rsquo; because of his cleverness in
impersonating one character, and then utterly dropping
out of sight and appearing as some other person.
We want him on a score of charges, two bank robberies,
attempted murder, several house burglaries, and
other things. His picture is in the Rogues&rsquo; Gallery,
but he has the art of changing his expression and
appearance so completely that, although I have seen
him twice since that was taken, at neither of those
times did his countenance resemble his photograph.
However, I feel positive from what this young man
tells me that it is none other than he. And as for
his confederates, I can readily guess who they are.
They are two Boston men, and are, no doubt, on their
way to the island now in the yacht. In this case, we
cannot act any too soon; and I shall ask Detective
Burns, who is familiar with the ground, to be my
right-hand man in the expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can count on me,&rdquo; replied Henry Burns,
with a smile at the title conferred upon him, and who
was, truth to tell, vastly flattered. &ldquo;I can answer,
moreover, for several good assistants, if you need
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Miles Burton, rising to go, &ldquo;I
will meet you at the train that leaves here to-morrow
afternoon. By to-morrow night I hope to have some
men on Grand Island who will give a pleasant little
surprise to Messrs. Craigie &amp; Co.;&rdquo; and, bowing
courteously, he took his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a surprising lack of jealousy in that man
Burton,&rdquo; remarked the banker, when he had gone.
&ldquo;He is disappointed to have the robbers slip through
his hands, and a little chagrined, I know, to have them
caught through the aid of a party of boys; but he took
pains not to show it, and, what&rsquo;s more, he will always
give you the credit for it when he speaks of it. That&rsquo;s
the kind of a man he is. He is as smart as a steel
trap, too, is Burton, and has done me good service
twice before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us not wait longer. I am going to take
you home with me to dinner, and have you spend
the night at my house. We shall feel more secure,
I assure you,&rdquo; he continued, smiling, &ldquo;with a detective
under our roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns declined, saying he was not dressed
for such hospitality, but the keen eye of the banker
had long before taken note of his neat and gentlemanly
appearance, and, moreover, liked the looks of the boy&rsquo;s
clear-cut features, and the way he had of looking one
fair in the eye, with a calm but manly and courageous
glance. So he waived the boy&rsquo;s objections, and
they entered the banker&rsquo;s carriage and were driven to
the finest home Henry Burns had ever visited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Perhaps they didn&rsquo;t make him at home there when
Mr. Curtis had told the story of the finding of the
jewels hidden in the cellar; and perhaps Henry Burns,
to his confusion, wasn&rsquo;t embraced by the banker&rsquo;s
wife, and perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t made a hero of by the
banker&rsquo;s two pretty daughters, who shuddered at the
story of the man in the cellar, and who made Henry
Burns tell it over and over again.</p>
<p>In short, he was treated with such wholesome and
charming hospitality as to set him to wondering, after
it was all over and he had gone to bed, whether he
had not missed something in his solitary life, brought
up without the love of father, mother, sister or
brother, in a home where noise and cheerfulness were
outlawed.</p>
<p>He was up bright and early the next day, and
he and the banker went to see Mr. Warren, who was
let into the secret, and the reward of five hundred
dollars was, through him, placed to the credit of the
boys. Then there was the aged aunt of Mrs. Carlin
to call upon, and the time passed quickly till it was
time for the afternoon train.</p>
<p>It was about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when
Henry Burns boarded the train in the company of
Miles Burton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the detective, as the train rattled noisily
on its way, &ldquo;I have been in Mayville and know several
parties there, but the island is new to me. However,
you can explain it to me from this map,&rdquo; and
Mr. Burton unrolled a map of the bay and island from
his pocket. &ldquo;I shall pick up three of my men, whom
I have ordered to meet us, in Mayville. One of
them came all the way down from New York with me
to help me work up this case. It is my opinion he
traced this man Craigie to Mayville and lost track
of him there. The man must have vanished, as he
has done so often before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go over to the island to-night in a launch.
Then we shall need some one to guide us to what you
call the haunted house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will meet you in the road by Captain Hervey&rsquo;s
house, right at the very head of the island,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns. &ldquo;It is the first house you come to on landing
at the outermost point. You cannot miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you get there? It is a long trip
up the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come on my bicycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital! You will go direct to the island, then,
by the night boat, arriving there, you say, at six
o&rsquo;clock. You will see just how the land lies, so you
can tell us, when we meet again. And you will instruct
your friends to keep close to Craigie, so he
won&rsquo;t be over there at the house to meet us on our
arrival. We want to do the welcoming for him, and
not have him do it for us. Two of the men I shall
bring are somewhat familiar with the island and know
one or two parties there; though I am not sure they
know where the haunted house is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of you boys must have a boat always in readiness
somewhere up the cove, on which you say this
house fronts, so that, the minute this man meets his
confederates aboard the yacht, one of you can slip
across the cove and let us know of it, in case we have
missed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Act carefully, and everything will be well; but once
give them cause for suspicion and they are dangerous
men to deal with. I have a little score of my own to
pay them,&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a long story, and I&rsquo;ll save it
for another time. Now let&rsquo;s go over this map, so I&rsquo;ll
be sure of my ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the train left Mayville, Miles Burton, with
a hurried handshake, left Henry Burns. It was a
little after six o&rsquo;clock when the latter stepped ashore
at Southport, where the boys were waiting for him,
upon the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is all right,&rdquo; said George Warren, in
answer to Henry Burns&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;He was not on
the roof at all during last night, for we divided up
into watches and kept a lookout from Tom&rsquo;s tent. He
evidently knows about what time his friends are to
arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Colonel Witham?&rdquo; asked Henry Burns.
&ldquo;Has he pined away any during my absence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any to notice,&rdquo; replied Tom Harris, &ldquo;but he
has gone away, down the island, to be gone two
days. You must stop with us to-night at the tent,
and the boys are all coming over to the tent now to
eat one of Bob&rsquo;s prime lobster stews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the crowd marched on Bob, and found him down
on the beach to the right of the tent, presiding over
an enormous kettle, which was hung over the glowing
coals of a fire of driftwood, and from which there
arose such a savoury odour of stew that, in a burst of
enthusiasm, they seized upon the stalwart young cook,
and, raising him on their shoulders, bore him with
hilarious shouts three times around the fire, much to
the apparent discomfiture of the quiet Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Then they sat about the fire while Tom brought
some tin plates and spoons from the tent and acted
as waiter, and Bob produced a pot of hot coffee and
some bread. It seemed as though nothing had ever
tasted so good. They called for stew till Bob&rsquo;s stout
right arm almost ached with wielding the long-handled
tin dipper that served them for a ladle.</p>
<p>The sun sank while they sat about the glow of
coals, and, by and by, the moon rose slowly over the
distant cape and poured a flood of soft light over the
waters of the bay. They remembered that night long
afterward, for its soft lights and its silent, mystical
beauty. The moon was at its full, and the tide crept up
on the beach almost to the bed of coals that remained
from the fire and still showed red. The islands far
off across the bay seemed to have drifted nearer in
to shore, and showed clear and distinct.</p>
<p>Henry Burns&rsquo;s story of the day&rsquo;s adventures lost
nothing of its interest, told down there on the shore by
the firelight and under the stars. His account of his
visit to the banker&rsquo;s, and how he had gained admittance
to Mr. Curtis&rsquo;s private office, filled them with
glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have liked to see him when he opened
that box,&rdquo; said young Joe. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he look surprised,
though, Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the banker&rsquo;s daughters,&mdash;were they pretty,
Henry?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice particularly,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry never does notice those things,&rdquo; said
Arthur, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, never!&rdquo; said young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows will notice something, if you don&rsquo;t
let up,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, getting a little red in spite
of himself.</p>
<p>Then he told them all that he had learned from
Mr. Miles Burton about the man Kemble, who was
not Kemble at all, but one Craigie, and a desperate
man; and all about the plans that were now to be put
into operation to capture Craigie and whosoever should
come to meet him.</p>
<p>The money, too, that had come to each one of them,
as his share of the reward, seemed like a fortune, while
no expedition that they had ever heard or read of
seemed half so full of mystery and danger as that
upon which they were now entering.</p>
<p>Sometime between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock Henry
Burns left them, and, proceeding to the hotel, unlocked
a door in the basement, got out his bicycle, and
rode away. In a little more than half an hour afterward
he had dismounted from his wheel at Captain
Hervey&rsquo;s house, four miles from the hotel, on the
western side of the island, near the head. The house
was closed, as the captain and his family were away
at sea. Down at the shore was an old boat-house,
where Henry Burns left his bicycle. He sat on the
edge of a bluff overhanging a landing-place for boats,
and waited for the launch. He could see her lights
already, out on the bay, and it was not long before
the little craft had come to shore. Four men disembarked,
and the launch steamed away again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Private Detective Burns,&rdquo; said Miles Burton,
laughing, as he came up the ladder from the
landing. Then he added, as he introduced the others
to the boy, &ldquo;This is a rival to Inspector Byrnes of
New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe him a good turn, Mason,&rdquo; continued
Miles Burton, &ldquo;for finding Craigie for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man addressed as Mason was the detective that
had followed Craigie as far as Mayville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, shaking hands with Henry Burns,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been after him a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two men, whose names were Stapleton
and Watkins, also shook hands with the boy. They
were sharp-eyed, athletic-looking men, whose appearance
on the island boded no good to one Craigie, alias
Kemble.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Henry Burns they all set
off down the road for a distance, then turned from it
and made their way through the fields and patches
of woods toward the bluff. It was hard walking there
in the darkness, through thickets and over little knolls,
with which some of the pastures were dotted, and it
was nearly one o&rsquo;clock in the morning when they
reached the old haunted house.</p>
<p>The house looked even less inviting than ever in
the waning moonlight, with its sagging roof, dull and
broken window-panes, and doors unhinged. Still, to
those free from superstition and not fearful of ghosts,
it offered a sufficient shelter on a summer night, and
they entered at a rear doorway, after making a cautious
reconnoisance to make certain that there was no
one within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Then, having shown them where the jewels had
been buried, and pointing out the location of a spring
of good water near the house, Henry Burns left the
four detectives to accommodate themselves to their
lodgings and went down to the shore. There in the
shadow of a bluff he found Tom and Bob waiting for
him in the canoe, as they had agreed.</p>
<p>When the canoe grated on the sand in front of the
tent, Henry Burns, worn out with his travels, was
fast asleep. So Tom and Bob, by way of a joke,
lifted up the canoe with its sleeping occupant and
carried it to the door of their tent. They thrust it
inside as far as it would go, laid Henry Burns out
flat in the bottom of it, made him comfortable with
blankets, without waking him from his heavy sleep,
and let him slumber on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE</span></h2>
<p>The inhabitants of the peaceful town of Southport
would have viewed the old haunted house
with more concern than ever if they had
known of the four ghosts that haunted it now, by day
and night. They were stalwart, able-bodied looking
ghosts, and their habits were strangely like what might
have been expected of four live men. Sometimes, as
they sat in one of the front garret rooms, by a window
that overlooked the town and the whole expanse of
the cove lying between it and the bluff, as well as the
bay beyond, a well-worn pack of cards was produced
by one of the spirits, and the four joined in a game.
Or, again, a bag was brought forth, and the spirits
ate heartily of the contents thereof.</p>
<p>It might have been noticed, too, that through it all
a certain careful vigilance on the part of the ghosts
was observed, as though they feared that if surprised
by a chance visitor they would have some trouble in
vanishing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Every few minutes throughout the day they made
by turns a careful survey of the cove and also of the
bay, sweeping it with a powerful field-glass. No more
than two of the ghosts ever took their sleep at the
same time, and that, too, during the day. When night
came they all redoubled their vigilance and remained
awake and alert. As darkness shut down they left the
house, one of them going out on the bluff and hiding
in a cleft of the rock, where he could overlook the
cove and the bay, the others hiding in the woods near
the house, and keeping watch on all its approaches.</p>
<p>They were very patient and very careful; for two
of them, who would have answered to the names of
Burton and Mason, knew that the men for whom they
watched, and who they knew would surely come within
a brief time now, were the men for whom they had
hunted for years, and by whose capture they should
win other rewards and settle scores of long standing.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, for the next two days and nights
a perfect contagion of watching seemed to have spread
through the village. Mr. Kemble, as he was known
to all, was a most annoyed man, and concealed his
annoyance only with difficulty. If, by chance, he
hobbled up the road of an afternoon, and wandered
off into the woods or fields, he was sure to come upon
some one of the boys, who seemed surprised enough
to see him, and was sure to remain with him till he
returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>If he hired a horse and went up the island for a
drive, he was sure to fall in most unexpectedly with
Henry Burns, spinning along on his wheel, and could
not shake him off. If he felt strong enough to get
into a rowboat and start out, weakly, across the cove,
groaning at the effort it cost him, he invariably fell
in with Tom and Bob, gliding along quietly in their
canoe, and they would insist on accompanying him,
and pointing out to him the beauties of the scenery
along the shores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>He would have considered far more seriously the
attention they paid to his movements by night, if he
had but known of them. If he could have seen six
pairs of eyes, striving to discern him as he appeared
on the hotel roof, or have known of the youths who
watched lest he cross the cove under cover of night,
to say nothing of those who awaited his coming on
the bluff itself, he might have worried more than he
did, and perhaps have played a shrewder game.</p>
<p>But neither did he nor any one else, other than they
who watched, know of it. And so it was that when,
a little before sunset on the third day after the arrival
of the ghosts in the haunted house, and while Mr.
Kemble sat on the front piazza of the hotel, looking
through a field-glass off on to the bay, admiring its
beauties with Mrs. Carlin, who thought him such an
unfortunate man,&mdash;and while, as he looked, he saw
the very yacht for which he had waited anxiously for
days, he surely believed that there was no one in the
village who would regard it with other than the usual
curiosity that fishermen and yachtsmen have for a
strange craft.</p>
<p>In this, unfortunately for him, he was mistaken.
There were others besides him who, on seeing the sail
emerge from between the islands, regarded it with
equal interest and even more excitement. Henry
Burns, being deeply interested in it, came and sat
down beside Mrs. Carlin long enough to hear Mr.
Kemble remark that he believed the yacht was the
<i>Eagle</i>, with his friends; in which case he should
spend the night aboard with them, and leave the harbour
early in the morning, if the wind availed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Henry Burns then quietly took his departure, sauntering
along until some cottages shut him out from
the view of the hotel, and then starting off on a run
as hard as ever he could toward the Warren cottage.
He paused long enough at the cottage to communicate
the news to young Joe, who was the first one he met,
and then, calling out that he would return as quickly
as he could, he ran through the woods down to the
shore.</p>
<p>Going up the cove some distance, Henry Burns
launched a rowboat and pulled rapidly across, landing
some ways above the bluff. Then he struck down
through the woods for the haunted house.</p>
<p>When Henry Burns returned a few minutes later,
two of the detectives were with him. The three rowed
across the cove and proceeded to the Warren cottage.
There the plan of operation, as it had been mapped
out by Miles Burton, was told by Henry Burns. Burton
and Mason were to make the arrest at the haunted
house. It was extremely unlikely that more than two
of the robbers would come for the box of jewels,&mdash;perhaps
Craigie alone. At all events, the detectives
would take chances against more than two coming,
and, if the three came, it would make no difference to
them. They would take them all by surprise, and
could arrest a dozen if necessary. If two of the boys
chose to go over to the bluff, they could do so, but
Miles Burton would not advise them to take the risk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The other two detectives were to wait in boats for
the man who should be left in the yacht, and arrest
him at the proper time. If any of the boys chose to
accompany these men, they could do so at their risk,
but Miles Burton had sent warning for them to take
no chances. Needless to say, his advice on this score
was thrown away. He might as well have advised
the boys not to breathe till it was all over. Their
blood was up, and they were one and all determined
to take part in the capture.</p>
<p>So it was decided that Bob and Henry Burns and
George should go over to the bluff; that Tom and one
of the detectives should take the canoe and lie in the
shadow of the shore, in wait near the tent; while
Arthur and Joe, with the other detective, should go
around the bluff in a rowboat, on a pretence of fishing,
and lie in concealment there behind the rocks.</p>
<p>During all this time the yacht, a white-hulled, sloop-rigged,
trim vessel, was rapidly nearing the village.
It came in fast, with a southeasterly breeze astern,
which blew fresh and which bade fair not to die down
with the setting of the sun. The yacht attracted some
attention among the people of the town, where fishing-boats
were more commonly seen than elegant
pleasure-craft. Its topmast was uncommonly tall, and
the club topsail, which was still set, was somewhat
larger than usual in a craft of its burden. In fact,
it was apparent to the experienced eye that, with all
its light sails set, the yacht would be enveloped in a
perfect cloud of canvas. It carried two jibs, besides
the forestaysail, but these were now furled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That craft carries sail enough to beat the <i>Flying
Dutchman</i>,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, who had joined the
group on the veranda that was watching the graceful
yacht coming in, with a tiny froth of foam at its
bows. &ldquo;Looks as though she could stand up under
it, though. Seems to be pretty stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is considered pretty fast,&rdquo; assented Mr.
Kemble. &ldquo;She has taken a few races around Boston
and Marblehead way, against some yachts that carried
even more sail. She belongs to a friend of mine, a
Mr. Brooks of Boston. He&rsquo;s a broker there, and can
afford to have as fast a craft as there is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast!&rdquo; returned Captain Sam. &ldquo;Any one can see
that with half an eye. Give her five minutes start,
and nothing in this bay could ever come within hailing-distance
of her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Sam little knew the relief and satisfaction
that his remark afforded Mr. Kemble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t want all that sail to-morrow, though,&rdquo;
continued Captain Sam. &ldquo;The wind is coming around
to the eastward for a storm of some kind. Looks more
like rain than wind, but there will be wind, too,&mdash;enough
to do all the sailing any one wants. You say
you&rsquo;ll sail to-morrow, do you, Mr. Kemble, rain or
shine? Well, that boat will stand it all right. She
looks as though she would just like a good blow, and
nothing better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mr. Kemble knew of any instances where the
yacht <i>Eagle</i>, alias <i>The Cloud</i>, alias <i>Fortune</i>, had proved
her marvellous speed to the chagrin of certain officers
of the law, and had demonstrated her ability to run
away from pursuers in both light and heavy weather,
he refrained, for reasons best known to himself, from
mentioning them. He gave, instead, a quiet assent
to the truth of Captain Sam&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>While tea was being served at the hotel, the yacht
entered the cove, and, rounding to gracefully with a
little shower of spray, dropped anchor about midway
between the wharf and the bluff opposite. The sails
were furled, with, strangely enough, the exception of
the mainsail, which was not even lowered. She would
doubtless drop this sail later, unless, by any chance,
she should decide to put out again during the night.</p>
<p>The men who had brought the yacht across the bay
did not come ashore. A thin column of smoke that
presently wreathed out of a funnel in the cabin indicated
that the yachtsmen were cooking a meal in the
galley aboard.</p>
<p>They were thorough yachtsmen, Mr. Kemble explained,
as he paid his bill and said good-bye to
Colonel Witham and Mrs. Carlin. They hardly ever
left the yacht, he said, except to buy provisions, or
some other errand of necessity. Mr. Kemble did not
specify what other errands of necessity he had in
mind.</p>
<p>The colonel saw just how it was, he said. He was
sorry, moreover, to lose Mr. Kemble as a guest. In
fact, he was the kind of guest that just suited the
colonel, as he went early to bed, minded his own
business, and was quiet. Good qualities in a summer
boarder, in the colonel&rsquo;s estimation.</p>
<p>There was no one to bid Mr. Kemble good-bye, save
the colonel and Mrs. Carlin, as he had made few
acquaintances. Henry Burns would have bid him a
pleasant voyage if he had been there, but Henry Burns
was not to be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He will be sorry not to have been here to say
good-bye to you,&rdquo; Mrs. Carlin explained, politely.
&ldquo;He often expressed the greatest sympathy for your
lameness. I cannot imagine where he is, and he has
had no supper, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bright boy, bright boy, that,&rdquo; responded Mr.
Kemble. &ldquo;Lives just out of Boston, does he? Must
look him and his aunt up this fall, and see if I can&rsquo;t
get my friend, Brooks, the broker, interested in him.
Well, good-bye,&rdquo; and, hobbling away, quite briskly
for him, Mr. Kemble followed a boy who carried his
satchel down to the wharf, and was rowed out to the
yacht. A voice from the cabin bade him welcome,
and he disappeared down the companionway.</p>
<p>Early that evening, and shortly after Mr. Kemble
had gone aboard the <i>Eagle</i>, for such was the name
painted freshly in gilt on the yacht&rsquo;s stern, Miles
Burton and the three boys, Bob, Henry Burns, and
George, held a consultation in the shadow of the
woods near the haunted house. Mason, in the meantime,
was hidden near the head of the rickety old
stairs at the landing on the bluff, watching for any
movement aboard the <i>Eagle</i>.</p>
<p>Miles Burton&rsquo;s commands were brief and explicit.
&ldquo;There is an old closet in the cellar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just
about opposite where the box was buried. Mason and
I will hide there. We have oiled the hinges of the
door so that it moves noiselessly. You boys better
keep close here in the woods till you hear from us.
Then you can make as much noise as you want to
and come in at the capture. There ought not to be
so very much excitement about it, for we shall have
them before they know what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>It certainly seemed as though the detective could
not be mistaken, but the sequel would show.</p>
<p>Mason remained at his post, and Miles Burton
and the boys sat together in the shadow of the woods.
It was wearisome waiting, and there was a chilliness
in the night air which had crept into it with the east
wind. When eleven o&rsquo;clock had come and the moon
should have shone over the cape, a bank of clouds
drifted up just ahead of it and half-obscured its light.
As the moon arose these clouds drifted higher in the
sky, still just preceding it, and the heavens grew but
little brighter. Still it was not absolutely dark, for
most of the stars were as yet unhidden.</p>
<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock came, and then one, and then a half-hour
went by. At just half-past one o&rsquo;clock by the
detective&rsquo;s watch they saw the figure of Mason stealing
swiftly up the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to make ready now,&rdquo; he said to Burton,
as he joined the party. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be at the landing
soon. As near as I can make out, there&rsquo;s Chambers
and French, besides Craigie. It&rsquo;s the men we want
all right. Chambers is rowing, and he will probably
stay in the boat while the other two come ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, bidding the boys to preserve the utmost
silence, the two detectives left them, and a moment
later the boys saw them disappear through the doorway
of the haunted house.</p>
<p>There was little need of warning the boys to make
no noise. From what the detectives had said, they
knew that the men they had to deal with were desperate
adventurers, who would not balk at any means
to escape capture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>So they lay close in the underbrush and peered
through the trees down toward the landing. The
night was still, save for the rustling of a light wind
through the trees. The breeze had held through, as
Captain Sam had prophesied, though it had abated
somewhat, ready, however, to increase with the next
turn of the tide a few hours later.</p>
<p>They could hear noises across in the village: a
solitary cart rattling along the country road, the tinkle
of a distant cow-bell in a pasture, and here and there
a dog barking. Presently the sound of oars grinding
in the rowlocks came to their ears, and a few moments
later the sound of a boat gently grating on the edge
of the stone landing. There was as yet no sound of
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; muttered Bob White. &ldquo;This waiting
here for something to happen gives me a creepy feeling.
I only wish we knew that they weren&rsquo;t armed to
the teeth and could only pitch in and run the risk of
a good fight. I&rsquo;d like to try a good football tackle,
just to keep my nerves from going to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care much to be waiting for them down
in that cellar,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re likely
to prove ugly customers when they find themselves
trapped,&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll risk Miles Burton to keep his head.
He&rsquo;s the kind of man for this sort of thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h,&rdquo; interrupted George Warren, softly. &ldquo;I
hear their voices. There&rsquo;s two of them, I think, talking.
Yes, here they come. Lie low, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A head appeared at the top of the ladder, and then
a man sprang up on to the brow of the bluff. It
was the man whom they had known as Mr. Kemble,
but whom they now knew as Craigie. He was followed
by another man, somewhat taller than he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The two came up the path together, talking earnestly.
At a certain point in the path they paused, and
Craigie stepped aside and found the spade where he
had hidden it in the brush. Then they went on toward
the haunted house. The boys&rsquo; hearts beat fast and
hard as the men passed close by where they lay hidden.
Surely two men who would lie in wait in the
old house for these two must possess good nerve and
courage. For the boys&rsquo; part, they were glad to be
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered Henry Burns, softly; &ldquo;the
tall one is downright angry with our friend Kemble.
He&rsquo;s pitching into him for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that Craigie&rsquo;s newly arrived friend
was in a bad humour. He spoke angrily, and no
longer in a low tone, but gruff and loud enough to
be heard some distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool you must have been, Craigie,&rdquo; they
heard him say, &ldquo;to hide the jewels away in this tumble-down
old place, when you could have hidden them
well enough on your own person. It&rsquo;s all well enough
to say they&rsquo;re safer here, but such an act might have
attracted attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; whispered Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here we are,&rdquo; continued the tall man, &ldquo;fooling
away our time in this outlandish hole, climbing
ledges and stumbling through woods, when we ought
to be out in the middle of the bay by this time, clear
of this place. There was the wind, holding on through
the night, just opportune for us, and all you needed
to do was to step aboard, if you had been ready,
and off we should have gone, without dropping a
sail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, French,&rdquo; answered Craigie, impatiently,
but trying to mollify his companion, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got time enough. Don&rsquo;t worry about that. You would
have blamed me bad enough if the jewels had been
found on me. Supposing I had had to tell you they&rsquo;d
been stolen, what would you have done? Would you
have believed it, or would you say I had stolen them
from you myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe it!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;Why, you know
I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. I know you too well for that.
What would I do? What would Ed Chambers do?
I tell you what we would do. After that job,&mdash;after
coming way down here for you,&mdash;why, man, we&rsquo;d
hunt you to the end of the earth, if you got away
with those jewels, but we&rsquo;d have you and the jewels,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this angry utterance, the tall man laid a heavy
hand on the other&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, man,&rdquo; returned the other, impatiently,
shaking off his grasp. &ldquo;What a way to talk about
nothing. You&rsquo;re in a precious bad humour, seems to
me. You know right well I wouldn&rsquo;t go back on you
and Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the sort,&rdquo; snarled the other
&ldquo;I know you, I tell you. I know you left us when
things got hot, and took the jewels that we risked
our necks for. Don&rsquo;t I know that we shouldn&rsquo;t have
seen or heard of you again till we had hunted for
you&mdash;which we would have done&mdash;if that man
Mason hadn&rsquo;t got so close up on to you that you
didn&rsquo;t dare try to get out of here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have it so, have it so, then, since you are
bound to quarrel,&rdquo; said Craigie, sullenly; and the boys
heard no more. The two men passed beyond hearing
and entered the haunted house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to miss this,&rdquo; whispered Henry
Burns, for once thoroughly excited. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going
to be the worst kind of trouble when that big black-looking
fellow finds the box gone. Burton&rsquo;s going to
let them dig for it&mdash;he told me so. Said he was
curious to see what they would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather he would have that sort of fun than I,&rdquo;
said Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal like watching a keg of
powder blow up. I say we&rsquo;d better stay right here, as
Burton advised, till we hear from them. We might
upset the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind saying I&rsquo;m scared clear down to my
boots,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to see the thing
through. I&rsquo;ll go if you will, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two left Bob in the woods, close by the
path to the shore, and crept up on their hands and
knees to that same cellar window through which they
had before witnessed the hiding of the box.</p>
<p>By the light of a lantern placed on the cellar floor
they saw the two men. Craigie had removed his coat,
and was digging in the earth where he had hidden the
box. He worked vigorously, throwing up spadefuls
of the soil with quick, nervous jerks. His tall companion
looked on with an expression of mingled anger
and contempt on his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>As the box failed to come to light after some minutes
of hard work, the drops of perspiration stood out
in great beads on Craigie&rsquo;s face, and he redoubled
his efforts with the spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s down deeper than I thought I buried it,&rdquo; he
muttered, with a sort of nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo; was all the other said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it so,&rdquo; said Craigie, and resumed his work.</p>
<p>The man was troubled, although he scarcely dared
admit it, even to himself. He had already dug far
deeper than he had before, and yet no signs of the
box. The spade trembled slightly in his hands. He
widened the hole and dug furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to dig over the whole cellar, I suppose,&rdquo;
sneered the other, and clenched his fists nervously.</p>
<p>Craigie did not reply. Perhaps the truth was beginning
to dawn on his mind, for he half-paused and
cast a quick, anxious glance at his companion. His
face was ghastly white in the dim lantern light. He
continued his digging.</p>
<p>All at once he uttered a cry. The boys, staring in
with faces close to the window-pane, saw the tall man
leap forward and deal him a heavy blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I am tricked by you?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;You know it isn&rsquo;t there. You knew it all the time.
But you don&rsquo;t fool me. You don&rsquo;t escape to enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craigie reeled under the blow and staggered back
against the wall. If the other had followed up his
advantage instantly, the fight must have been his; but
one moment was enough for his companion. Still
grasping the spade, he struck out with it as the man
French rushed upon him again, and the other, receiving
the full force of the blow, fell to the floor.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="&ldquo;CRAIGIE REELED UNDER THE BLOW AND STAGGERED BACK AGAINST THE WALL&rdquo;" width="500" height="759" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;CRAIGIE REELED UNDER THE BLOW AND STAGGERED BACK AGAINST THE WALL&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>The next instant, without waiting to see whether
his companion were dead or alive, Craigie shattered
the lantern with a single blow and darted for the
cellar stairs. At the same moment the detectives threw
open the door and rushed out into the cellar. They
were just too late. One man, indeed, lay unconscious
at their feet, but the other had already reached the
cellar stairs, and was at the outer door in a moment
more.</p>
<p>Down in the woods, by the path to the landing, Bob
saw a sight that sent the hot blood to his cheeks. He
had heard shots from the cellar, fired by the detectives
after the fleeing Craigie, and wondered what they
meant. Now, to his dismay, he saw Craigie at full
speed flying along the path toward him.</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet, though his heart beat
furiously, and he trembled so that for a moment he
clung to a tree for support. Then he thought of Tom,
and it gave him courage. Standing as he had stood
often before on the football field at home, when, as
right tackle, he had saved many a goal, he waited
breathlessly. Then as Craigie dashed up, he sprang
out, tackled him about the legs, and the two fell
heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>He was half-stunned by the fall, but he had breath
enough to cry for help, and clung like a drowning man
to his antagonist. Well for him then that, in his
flight, Craigie had dropped the weapon he carried.
They rolled over and over for a moment, and then
the man had Bob in his grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; he cried, fiercely. &ldquo;Let me go, I
say!&rdquo; Bob felt his strength going, as the powerful
arms tightened about him.</p>
<p>All at once, however, the other&rsquo;s grasp loosened.
Craigie felt himself borne backward, as two boyish
figures rushed out of the darkness and threw themselves
upon him. Then a weapon gleamed at his head,
and Miles Burton stood over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; cried Craigie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me this
time, though you had to get a boy to do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me,&rdquo; replied Miles Burton,
coolly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you, that&rsquo;s the main thing. Here,
Mason, here&rsquo;s our man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason, running up, stooped over the prostrate form
for a moment, there was the sharp snap of steel, and
Craigie lay helpless with a pair of handcuffs fastened
to his wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s French?&rdquo; he asked, sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you left him,&rdquo; said Mason. &ldquo;It was a
bad cut you gave him. He won&rsquo;t run away. That&rsquo;s
certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve him right,&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Miles Burton, as the
sound of two pistol-shots came up from the water.
&ldquo;They seem to be having trouble down there, too.
You wait here, Mason, and I&rsquo;ll get down to the
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran to the steps, followed by the three boys.
Down the rickety stairs they scrambled, and quickly
stood on the ledge of the little landing, looking off
on to the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>What they saw was the yacht <i>Eagle</i>, not far from
the bluff, under full mainsail, standing out of the cove.
At some distance astern was the rowboat, in which
were Arthur and Joe at the oars. The detective stood
at the bow with a smoking revolver in his hand. Not
far distant, across the cove, was the canoe containing
the other detective and Tom. The detective also had
just fired. Miles Burton and the boys could see no
one aboard the sloop, but still it sailed steadily on its
course. The canoe vainly tried to head it off, but
the yacht, obedient to an unseen hand at the wheel,
quickly came about and went off on the other tack,
soon putting a hopeless distance between it and its
pursuers.</p>
<p>They could not see the man aboard, for the reason
that he lay flat in the cockpit, and, with one arm
upraised, directed the course of the yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity! What a pity!&rdquo; said Miles Burton,
talking softly to himself. &ldquo;How could it have happened?
I would rather have lost the other two than
that man Chambers. He&rsquo;s the most dangerous man
of the three, and the man I wanted most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face showed the keenest disappointment, but
he had learned self-control in his business, and refrained
from speaking above his ordinary tone of
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen, Watkins?&rdquo; he asked, as the
rowboat came in to the landing for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all our fault, Burton,&rdquo; said the other, bitterly.
&ldquo;Stapleton and I should have closed in the moment
we heard the first shots; and we should have got
aboard the yacht and waited. But I was not sure
but what Chambers would land and go up the bluff
to the rescue of his comrades, and so I waited to see
what he would do. I might have known him better.
These fellows are always looking out for number one,
and that&rsquo;s a safe rule to go by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All at once we saw him come out from the shadow
of the bluff, rowing as hard as ever he could for
the yacht. We were after him then, both Stapleton
and I. And I&rsquo;m certain of one thing. No one could
have got us out to that yacht faster than these boys.
They rowed like men. But, you see, he had but a
few strokes of the oars to pull, compared with us.
And he got to the yacht when we were still some rods
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed but what we had him then, for
his anchor was down. But what did he do but spring
aboard, not stopping to see what became of his rowboat,
rush forward as quick as a cat, whisk out a
knife, and cut his hawser before you could say &lsquo;Scat.&rsquo;
Then he jumped aft mighty quick, grabbed the wheel
as cool as anything you ever saw, and had her under
headway in no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took long chances, standing up when he went
about, and dodging down again, at first. Then when
we came close he got down in the bottom of the boat,
just as you saw him, and the best we could do was to
fire where we thought he ought to be. He dodged
back and forth between our boats, tacking right and
left as quick as anything I ever saw, and just slipped
by us. He couldn&rsquo;t have done it in any ordinary boat,
but that yacht just spun around like a weather-vane,
and seemed to gain headway as she went about, instead
of losing anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything so beautiful, if I do say it.
Look at her now, just eating away there to windward
and leaving this harbour out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yacht was, indeed, flying along like the wind.
Chambers had got more sail on her now, and they
could see him, coolly sitting at the wheel and waving
a hand in derision back at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; said Burton. &ldquo;Here we are on
an island, with no way of getting a telegram started till
the morning boat lands over at Mayville. That will
be many hours yet, and I fear he&rsquo;ll give us the slip
for good and all. What luck, that it should have been
he, the only seaman of the three, who was left with
the boat. Neither of the others could have done what
he did. He&rsquo;s probably studied these waters some,
enough to find his way down here, and it will be a
hard task ever picking him up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but a man can&rsquo;t conceal a yacht,&rdquo; said George
Warren. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know her anywhere. You can telegraph
a description, and the whole coast will be on
the watch. You can describe exactly how she looks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; laughed Miles Burton. &ldquo;Yes, I can,
but that&rsquo;s all the good it&rsquo;s likely to do. He&rsquo;ll have
her so changed over, if he gets a day to himself down
among those islands, that the man who built her
wouldn&rsquo;t recognize her. It won&rsquo;t be the first time
he has done it. He carries a full equipment aboard,
a different set of sails, different fitting spars, different
gear of all kinds, and paint to change her colour. Once
let him get in near a sheer bluff, where he can lay
alongside, with some trees growing close to the water&rsquo;s
edge, so he can rig a tackle and heel her way over,
and he will have a yacht of a different colour before
she&rsquo;s many hours older. He did the thing up in Long
Island Sound for several years, and changed her name
a half a dozen times into the bargain. He&rsquo;s done
some smuggling up along the Canadian border, too,
I&rsquo;m told, and there isn&rsquo;t a better nor a more daring
seaman anywhere in this world. However, we&rsquo;ll do
the best we can. Lend a hand, now, all of you; we&rsquo;ve
got to get that wounded man down over the bluff,
or down through the woods, and row him across the
cove, where we can get a doctor to dress that wound
of his. He&rsquo;s not dangerously hurt, I believe, but he&rsquo;s
faint and sick, and we must work spry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-hour later, at the wharf across the cove,
before the eyes of an excited crowd, composed of
villagers, cottagers, and hotel guests, who had gathered
hurriedly at the sound of the firing, there was
landed a strange boat-load,&mdash;the strangest that had
ever come ashore at the harbour. Imagine the amazement
of Colonel Witham upon beholding his favourite
guest, Mr. Kemble, bundled unceremoniously out of
the rowboat, with manacles upon his wrists. Imagine
the concern of the villagers when the man French,
his wound clumsily swathed in bandages and his face
pale and distressed, was lifted ashore and carried
bodily up the slip to the nearest shelter. Nothing like
it had ever happened before, not in all the island&rsquo;s
history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say you knew that man was a burglar
for two or three days, and let him stay in the house
and didn&rsquo;t tell us?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Carlin, wrathfully,
of Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re not the worst boy I ever had the
care of. Here we might all have been murdered and
robbed, and you&rsquo;d be as guilty as he. And to think
I sat and talked with him there, and shook hands with
him when he went away. Henry Burns, you&rsquo;ll go to
bed an hour earlier for a week for this. And you
deserve worse punishment than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns assumed his most penitent expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">AN UNPLEASANT DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Two weeks had passed by. Craigie and French
were in jail awaiting trial, and the sensational
arrest had run its course in the papers. Messages
had sped here and there, and the police of many
cities and towns were watching day and night for the
missing Chambers. But watchers&rsquo; efforts were futile.
If the sea had opened and swallowed him up, the man
could not have disappeared more completely. Not one
of the harbours along the coast sighted him, nor did
he run to any for shelter. It had come on stormy the
morning he sailed away, and something like a gale had
set in the next night. So that there were some who
believed it more than likely that the yacht <i>Eagle</i> had
foundered, with only one man to handle her.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, yacht and man had utterly disappeared.
Several times it was thought she was sighted
by some pursuer, but it always turned out to be some
other craft. Chambers had made good his escape.
And he alone knew to what use he intended to put
that freedom.</p>

<p>The bright August sun glared in through the canvas
tent on a hot afternoon. It fell warm upon Tom, who,
divested of his jersey and bared to the waist, stood in
the centre of the tent, performing a series of movements
with a pair of light wooden dumb-bells. A fine
specimen of sturdy young manhood was Tom, lithe
and quick in action. A skin clear and soft, bright
eyes, muscles that knotted into relief when flexed and
rounded into nice proportion when relaxed, quick,
decisive movements, all told of athletics and an abstinence
from pipes and tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; he said, presently, to Bob, after he
had counted off several hundred numbers. Tossing
his chum the dumb-bells, he slipped on his jersey again,
and, reclining at ease on one of the bunks, watched
Bob go through the same drill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, I&rsquo;m envious of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are
blacker by several shades than I am. I&rsquo;ll have to take
it out of you with the gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty hot,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heat doesn&rsquo;t bother a man when he is in training,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the flabby fellows that get sun-strokes.
Sun does one good when he&rsquo;s hardened
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fished out a pair of old boxing-gloves, that
looked as though they had seen hard service, from the
chest, and then he and Bob went at it, as though they
had been the most bitter enemies, instead of the most
inseparable of friends. They led and countered and
pummelled each other till the perspiration poured down
their faces and they had begun to breathe hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for to-day.
I think you had just a shade the better of it, old chap.
Now let&rsquo;s cool off in the canoe. You know what&rsquo;s
on the programme this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I did,&rdquo; answered Bob; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be
hungry enough for it by the time things are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried their canoe down to the shore, and in
a moment were paddling down the island toward the
narrows. But they were not destined to go alone.
Turning a point of ledge some little distance below
Harvey&rsquo;s camp, they came all at once upon Arthur
and Joe Warren, walking along the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take us in there, Tom,&rdquo; cried Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take one of you,&rdquo; answered Tom, pointing
the canoe inshore with a turn of his paddle.</p>
<p>Arthur caught the end of the canoe as it came up
alongside a ledge on which the boys stood, and
steadied the frail craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well let us both in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The more
the merrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more the riskier, too,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;but if
you fellows will take the chance of a ducking, I&rsquo;m
willing. Water won&rsquo;t spoil anything I&rsquo;ve got on.
Climb in easy, now, and sit cross-legged, so if we tip
over you&rsquo;ll slide out head-first, clear of the thwarts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoe was brought to within nearly an inch
of the water&rsquo;s edge by the addition of the two to its
burden. Tom gave a strong push with his paddle,
and the heavily laden craft glided away from the
shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>There was an extra paddle, which Arthur wielded
after a fashion, and it did not take long to come
within sight of the narrows. There upon the shore
were gathered some fifty or sixty persons. Over
against a ledge a fire of driftwood blazed. When they
had gotten in nearer they could see a smaller fire at
a little distance from the other. Over this was hung
a monster iron kettle, and bending over it and superintending
the cooking of its contents was a familiar
figure. It was Colonel Witham, and he was making
one of his famous chowders.</p>
<p>At the same time that the occupants of the canoe
discerned the colonel, he in turn espied them, and also
noted a circumstance which they did not. A half-mile
or more distant from them a big, ocean-going tugboat
was passing down the bay, without a tow and
under full steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There come those mischief-makers,&rdquo; said the colonel,
muttering to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if the canoe
isn&rsquo;t filled with them. If there&rsquo;s an inch of that canoe
out of water, there&rsquo;s no more.&rdquo; Then, as he noted the
tug steaming past, an idea came to him that made
him chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kicks up a big sea, that craft does,&mdash;as much as
a steamboat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ll see it and
perhaps not. If they don&rsquo;t just let one of those waves
catch them unawares. There&rsquo;ll be a spill.&rdquo; The colonel,
chuckling with great satisfaction, went on stirring
the chowder.</p>
<p>The possibility of a wave from a chance steamer
had, indeed, not been thought of by Tom or any of
the others. The water was motionless all about them,
but rolling in rapidly toward them were a series of
waves big enough to cause trouble, if they did but
know it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>The colonel watched the unequal race between the
waves and the heavily-laden canoe with interest. He
looked out at them every other minute from the corner
of his eye. He was afraid lest others on shore
should see their danger and warn them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them spill over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They can all
swim like fish, and a ducking will do them good.&rdquo;
So he stirred vigorously, watching them all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stuff won&rsquo;t need any pepper if he cooks it,&rdquo;
remarked young Joe, looking ahead at the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for us it&rsquo;s not his own private picnic,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;or we shouldn&rsquo;t get much of it. Even as it is,
it sort of takes my appetite away to see him stirring
that chowder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk your appetite&mdash;&rdquo; The words were hardly
out of Arthur&rsquo;s mouth when precisely what Colonel
Witham had been hoping for came to pass. All at
once Tom, seated in the stern, saw the water suddenly
appear to drop down and away from the canoe.
The canoe was for an instant drawn back, then lifted
high on the ridge of a wave and thrown forward,
with a sharp twist to one side. Tom gave one frantic
sweep with his paddle, in an effort to swing the canoe
straight before the wave, but it was too late. The
canoe was overloaded, and as the weight of the four
boys was thrown suddenly to one side the sensitive
thing lost its equilibrium and capsized.</p>
<p>In a moment the four boys were struggling in the
water. Thanks to Tom&rsquo;s precaution, they all went
out headforemost, and came to the surface clear of
the canoe, blowing and sputtering. A cry went up
from the shore, and for a moment Colonel Witham
was seized with a sudden fear. What if any of them
should be drowned, and he, to vent a petty spite, had
given no warning? In his excitement he failed to
notice that he had spilled some pepper into the ladle
which he held in one hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Two rowboats were hastily started out from the
beach, and, impelled by strong arms, surged toward
the canoe.</p>
<p>Tom was prompt to act. He and Bob had had
many a drill at this sort of thing. Each of the boys
was a good swimmer, and soon they were all clinging
to the canoe, which had completely overturned. The
boys were in about the same positions as they had
occupied in the canoe, Tom at one end, Bob at the
other, and the other two clinging each to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, boys, let&rsquo;s right her before the boats get
here,&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>Under his directions the two Warren boys now took
their positions both on the same side of the canoe,
with himself and Bob at the ends. Then all four took
long breaths, treaded water vigorously, and lifted.
The canoe rose a little and rolled over sluggishly, two-thirds
full of water.</p>
<p>While the others supported it, Tom bailed the canoe
nearly dry with a bailing-dish, which he always kept
tied to a thwart for just such an emergency. Then
he climbed in over one end, and Bob followed over
the other. The Warren boys clung to the gunwales
until one of the boats from the shore picked them up.
The paddles were recovered for Tom and Bob, and the
three craft proceeded to shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>There, stretching themselves out on the hot sands
before the blaze, they waited for their clothing to
dry on them. They were much liked by the boys and
girls of the village, and were at once a part of a jolly
group, each of which party had a separate detail to
recount in the capsizing of the canoe as they had
seen it.</p>
<p>All at once the picnickers were startled by a howl
of rage from Colonel Witham. All eyes were turned
upon him. He was executing the most extraordinary
contortions and dance-steps that could be imagined.
An Indian chief, excelling all his tribe at a war-dance,
could not have outdone the grotesque movements of
the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails the man?&rdquo; cried Captain Sam. &ldquo;He
must have gone clean crazy.&rdquo; And he started for the
colonel on the run.</p>
<p>But before he could reach him another accident
happened. In his dancing about, the colonel trod
most unexpectedly on a small log of wood, his heels
flew out from under him, and down he came with a
mighty splash in a little pool of sea-water that had
been left in a hollow of rock by the last receding tide.</p>
<p>There the colonel lay, like an enormous turtle, helpless
for a moment with rage and astonishment, and
all the while sputtering fiercely and crying out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth ails you, colonel?&rdquo; asked Captain
Sam, hurrying to his assistance. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t gone
crazy, have you?&rdquo; And he helped the colonel to his
feet with a great effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper!&rdquo; roared the purple-faced colonel. &ldquo;Pepper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper!&rdquo; cried Captain Sam. &ldquo;What about
pepper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything about it!&rdquo; sputtered the colonel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
in the chowder! Taste it and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Captain Sam. &ldquo;If those
young scamps have peppered the chowder I&rsquo;ll thrash
every one of them myself. Here, let me see,&rdquo; and,
picking up the ladle which the colonel had dropped,
he cautiously tasted the chowder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no pepper in it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
right. I don&rsquo;t taste any pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As, indeed, he did not, the colonel having got it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have a strong imagination, colonel,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagination!&rdquo; bellowed the colonel. &ldquo;Imagination!
I just wish your tongue was stuck full of a
million red-hot needles and your mouth was filled
with hornets, that&rsquo;s all I wish. Where&rsquo;s the boy that
put that pepper into that spoon? Where is he? Show
him to me and I&rsquo;ll make an example of him right
here. I&rsquo;ll put him head first into the chowder by the
heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As no one had put the pepper into the ladle, no
culprit could be found to show to the colonel; and
as the colonel could not select a victim out of a score
or more of boys who were present, he could only vent
his rage to no purpose, while the villagers, who had
laughed themselves nearly sick over the colonel&rsquo;s antics,
gave him what sympathy they could feign.</p>
<p>It ended in the colonel&rsquo;s taking himself off in a
great fury, declaring that any one who pleased could
make the chowder, and he hoped it would choke them
all, and that fish-bones innumerable would stick in
the throats of whoever ate it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The colonel&rsquo;s departure, however, far from putting
any damper on the occasion, seemed rather to afford
the party a relief; and his mishap made no small part
of their amusement, as they went on with the preparations
for the feasting.</p>
<p>Captain Sam, who could turn his hand to anything,
took the position left vacant by the colonel,
and declared he could bring the chowder to completion
in a way vastly superior to the colonel&rsquo;s. And
indeed it was a decided improvement in the appearance
of things to see the good-natured captain standing
over the steaming kettle and cracking jokes with every
pretty girl that went by.</p>
<p>The preparations for the clambake went merrily on.
A huge pile of driftwood was brought up from the
shore and heaped on the fire by the ledge. There were
pieces of the spars of vessels, great junks of shapeless
timber that had once been ship-knees and pieces of
keels, timbers that had drifted down from the mills
away up the river, now thrown up on shore after miles
and miles of aimless tossings, and crates and boxes
that had gone adrift from passing steamers and come
in with weeks of tides. The flames consumed them
all with a fine roaring and crackling, and, dying down
at length after an hour or two, left at a white heat
beneath the ashes a bed of large flat rocks that had
been carefully arranged.</p>
<p>Several of the boys, with brooms made of tree
branches, swept the hot stones clean of ashes; clean
as an oven they made it. Then they brought barrels
of clams, big fat fellows, with the blue yet unfaded
from their shells, and poured them out on the hot
stones, whence there arose a tremendous steaming and
sizzling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Quickly they pitched damp seaweed over the clams,
from a stack heaped near, covering them completely
to the depth of nearly a foot. Then on this, wherever
they saw the steam escaping, they shovelled the
clean coarse gravel of the beach, so that the great
broad seaweed oven was nearly air-tight.</p>
<p>Then they heaped the hot ashes in a mound and
buried therein potatoes and corn with the thick green
husks left on it.</p>
<p>The women, meantime, had not been idle, for in
a grove that skirted the beach they had spread table-cloths
on the long tables that always stood there,
winter and summer, fastened into the ground with
stakes driven firm. If all that great steaming bed
of clams and the chowder in the mammoth kettle had
suddenly vanished or burned up, or had some other
catastrophe destroyed it, there would still have been
left a feast for an army in what was spread on the
snowy tables from no end of fat-looking baskets.</p>
<p>There were roast chickens and ducks, sliced cold
meats, and country sausages. There were pies enough
to make a boy&rsquo;s head swim,&mdash;apple, mince, pumpkin,
squash, berry, custard, and lemon,&mdash;in and out of
season; chocolate cakes and raisin cakes and cakes
of all sizes and forms. There were preserves and
pickles and a dozen and one other messes from country
cupboards, for the good housewives of Grand Island
were generous souls, and used to providing for a
hearty lot of seafaring husbands and sons and brothers,
and, moreover, this picnic at the Narrows was a
yearly event, for which they made preparation long
ahead, and looked forward to almost as much as they
did to Christmas and New Year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Never were tables more temptingly spread, and
when, late in the afternoon, the benches around these
tables were filled with expectant and hungry picnickers,
it was a sight worth going miles to see.</p>
<p>Captain Sam pronounced the chowder done, and the
great kettle, hung from a stout pole, was borne in
triumph by him and Arthur Warren to the grove near
the tables. Somebody else pronounced the clams done,
and the gravel was carefully scraped off from the seaweed,
and the seaweed lifted from the clams, and the
great stone oven with its steaming contents laid bare.
The very fragrance from it was a tonic.</p>
<p>Bowls of the chowder and big plates of the clams
were carried to the tables. There were dishes of the
hot corn piled high; potatoes that came to table black
as coals, and which, being opened, revealed themselves
white as newly popped corn. There was a mingled
odour of foods, piping hot, and over all the grateful
aroma from half a dozen coffee-pots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracky! do they expect us to eat all this?&rdquo; exclaimed
young Joe, as he surveyed the prospect. &ldquo;I
wonder where it is best to begin&mdash;and what to leave
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to eat it all, Joe,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Give
somebody else a chance, too. You know the night
you went to Henry Burns&rsquo;s party you ate so many
nuts and raisins you woke up dreaming that somebody
was trying to tie you into a square knot, and when
you got fully awake you wished somebody would,
and I had to get up and pour Jamaica ginger into
you. Don&rsquo;t try to eat more than enough for three
ordinary persons this time, Joe, and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Young Joe tried to smile, with a slice of chicken
in one hand and a spoonful of preserves in the other,
and a mouthful of both. His reputation at the table
had been made long before that day, and had gone
abroad, and here was the opportunity of a lifetime,
for every good-hearted motherly-looking housewife
within reaching distance was passing him food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s a seat for me,&rdquo; said Henry Burns,
who came hurrying up. He and George Warren had
made the run down the island on bicycles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, both of you,&rdquo; cried the crowd. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
always room for you,&rdquo; and made places for them at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems too bad not to invite those other campers
up on the shore,&rdquo; said one of the women. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
they haven&rsquo;t had anything as good as this for all
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Harvey&rsquo;s crew?&rdquo; queried a chorus of
voices, in astonishment. &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t live near
enough to where they are camping to be bothered by
them. If you did, you wouldn&rsquo;t want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind some kind of jokes so much,&rdquo; continued
one of the villagers, at which Tom and Bob
and Henry Burns and the Warren boys tried to look
unconscious, &ldquo;but when it comes to taking things that
don&rsquo;t belong to them and continually creating a disturbance,
we think it is going a little too far. Perhaps
it might do them good to get them over here and
repay them with kindness, but some of us are not just
in the mood for trying it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late now, if we
wanted to, for I saw them starting out about half
an hour ago in their yacht, and wondered where they
could be trying to go, with wind enough to barely stir
them. Some mischief, like as not, they&rsquo;re up to. No
good errand, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was quite true.</p>
<p>However, in most surprising contradiction to the
speaker&rsquo;s assertion, there suddenly appeared along the
shore Harvey and all his crew, walking close to the
water&rsquo;s edge, but plainly to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those boys must have changed their minds
quickly,&rdquo; said the man who had spoken before. &ldquo;It
is not more than half an hour, surely, since I saw
them all starting out in the yacht. I guess they found
there was not enough wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, there had been wind enough for
the purpose of Harvey and his crew. There was
enough, at all events, to carry them up past the village
and back again to their mooring-place. If they
had had any object in doing that, there had been
wind enough to satisfy them. They seemed, moreover,
in high spirits when they returned from this
brief voyage, and laughed heartily as they made the
yacht snug for the night.</p>
<p>Now they went whistling past the picnic party, all
of them in line, and went down along the shore till
they were lost to view in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they&rsquo;re not going down my way,&rdquo; said some
one. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up to altogether too much mischief
around here; that is, I know well enough it&rsquo;s them,
but I can&rsquo;t ever succeed in catching them at it. I&rsquo;d
make it hot for them if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Harvey and his crew had surely no designs on
the property of any one down the island, for they
had not gone far in the grove of woods before Harvey
called a halt, and they all sat down and waited. It
was rapidly growing dusk, and they waited until it
had grown quite dark. Then they arose, cut across
through the grove toward the Narrows again, but
keeping out of sight all the while, both of chance
villagers who might be passing along the road, and
of the crowd about the picnic fire.</p>
<p>When they had come to the Narrows, Harvey again
called a halt, and stole ahead to see if the coast was
clear. The island was a narrow strip of land here,
with the bay on either hand coming in close to the
roadway, but by keeping close to the water&rsquo;s edge,
and dodging behind some low cedars, provided the
campers were all about the fire, they might pass unobserved.
This they managed successfully, for, the
driftwood fire having been renewed, the picnic party
were seated about it, singing and telling stories.</p>
<p>Harvey and his crew went on up through the woods
to their own camp, where two of them remained, while
Harvey and George Baker and Allan Harding took
their yacht&rsquo;s tender and rowed rapidly on up toward
the town. After they had started, Joe Hinman and
Tim Reardon stole down through the woods again,
and kept watch for a long time on the group about
the fire. They did not return to their camp till the
sound of a horn, some hour and a half later, signified
to them that Harvey and the others had returned from
their mission, whatever it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>The driftwood fire began to blaze low as the evening
wore on, and by nine o&rsquo;clock the greater number of
the picnickers had said &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; and started
on their journey home. Some of them had come from
away down at the foot of the island, and still others
from the little settlement at the head. These now
harnessed in their horses, which had been allowed to
feed near the grove, and drove away, their flimsy old
wagons rattling along the road like so many wrecks
of vehicles.</p>
<p>Around the fire, however, there still lingered a
group of fishermen and village folk, telling stories and
gossiping over their pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whatever became of that fellow Chambers,&rdquo;
said one. &ldquo;He was the slickest one of the lot,
so that Detective Burton said. Do you recall how he
sailed away that morning, as cool as you please, with
the pistols popping all around his head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject had never ceased to be the one great
topic of interest in the village of Southport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;ll never be seen around these parts
again,&rdquo; remarked another. &ldquo;Like as not he&rsquo;s up in
Long Island Sound long before this. Or maybe the
yacht&rsquo;s hauled up somewhere, and he&rsquo;s got clear out
of the country. There&rsquo;s no telling where those fellows
will travel to, if they&rsquo;re put to it, according to what
I read in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty mysterious,&rdquo; said Captain Sam. &ldquo;For
my part, I think it&rsquo;s queer nobody&rsquo;s sighted him
somewhere along the coast. A man don&rsquo;t sail for days
without somebody seeing him. He ought to be heard
from along Portland way, that is, if he ever left this
bay, which I ain&rsquo;t so sure of, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark seemed to amuse most of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems as though you expected you might see him
and that crack yacht some night sailing around here
like the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>,&rdquo; said one, at which the
others took their pipes out and chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to get out your old <i>Nancy Jane</i> and go scouring
the bay after him, Cap&rsquo;n Sam. If he ever saw her
coming after him, he&rsquo;d haul down his sail pretty quick
and invite you to come aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Captain Sam, good-naturedly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no accounting for the strange things of the
sea, as you ought to know, Bill Lewis, with the deep-water
voyages you&rsquo;ve been on. Still, I&rsquo;m free to say
I don&rsquo;t see how that &rsquo;ere craft can have got out of here
and gone clear up Boston way or New York, without
so much as a sail being sighted by all them as has
been watching for her. I don&rsquo;t try to explain where
he may be, but I stick to my idea that there&rsquo;s something
mighty queer about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be at the bottom of this &rsquo;ere bay,&rdquo; said
the man addressed as Bill Lewis. &ldquo;Stranger things
than that have happened, and he was but one man in
a big boat on a coast he couldn&rsquo;t have known but little
of. There&rsquo;s many a reef for him to hit in the night,
and the day he escaped was stormy. For that matter,
I give it up, too. He was a slick one, that&rsquo;s all I
can say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>And so they rolled this strange and mysterious bit
of gossip over, while the fire burned to coals and the
coals died away to ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Bob, as they launched the canoe from
the shelving beach some time after ten o&rsquo;clock, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
too glorious a night to go right home to bed. What
do you say to a short paddle, just a mile or so out
in the bay, to settle that terrible mixture of pie and
clams that we&rsquo;ve eaten? We&rsquo;ll sleep all the sounder
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps &rsquo;twill save our lives,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;I
ate more than I&rsquo;ve eaten in the last week. Let&rsquo;s take
it easy, though. I don&rsquo;t feel like hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they paddled leisurely out for about a mile, enjoying
the brilliant starlight and watching the dark
waters of the bay flash into gleams of phosphoric fire
at every stroke of the paddle. It was like an enchanted
journey, gliding along through the still night,
amid pools of sparkling gems.</p>
<p>It was nearing eleven when they drove the bow of
their canoe in gently upon the sand at their landing-place
and stepped out upon the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three&mdash;pick her up,&rdquo; said Tom, as
each grasped a thwart of the canoe, ready to swing
it up on to their shoulders. Up it came, fairly on to
the shoulders of Bob, who had the bow end, but Tom,
who never fumbled at things, seemed somehow to
have made a bad mess of it. His end of the canoe
dropped clumsily to the ground, twisting Bob&rsquo;s head
uncomfortably and surprising that young gentleman
decidedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Tom?&rdquo; he asked, laughing
good-naturedly, as he turned to his companion. But
Tom for a moment answered never a word. He stood
staring ahead like one in a dream. Bob, amazed,
looked in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; whispered Tom, huskily, &ldquo;do you see&mdash;it&rsquo;s
gone&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t there. Do you see&mdash;the camp&mdash;the
old tent&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone, as sure as we&rsquo;re standing
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rushed forward to where the tent had been
but a few hours before that afternoon, and stood there
dismayed. There in the open air were their bunks,
their camp-stools, their camp-kit, and the great chest;
but the tent that had sheltered them had disappeared.
Around about the spot were holes where the stakes
that had held it had been hastily wrenched out, but
not a scrap of canvas nor a piece of rope that had
guyed it were to be seen. Only the poles that had been
its frame lay upon the ground. Their tent had utterly
vanished.</p>

<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A CRUISE AROUND THE ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bob,&rdquo; said Tom, as they seated themselves
on the bunks to collect their wits
and think the situation over, &ldquo;we know
who did it, of course. The next thing is to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so easy,&rdquo; responded Bob. &ldquo;Jack
Harvey hasn&rsquo;t done this thing without first planning
out how he could dispose of the tent without attracting
the slightest attention. He planned it in a good
time, too, when half the village was away at the clambake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s what he sailed out
on that short trip for, to look in at our tent without
exciting any suspicion. He found out that there
wasn&rsquo;t anybody around it, and then he and the others
came down past our fire on purpose for us to see them
and to prove by every one there that they were in
another part of the island when our camp was stolen.
He did it, though, and he&rsquo;s covered it up well. We&rsquo;ll
have hard work to prove it against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be madder to-morrow, when I&rsquo;m not so sleepy.&rdquo;
said Bob. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on up to the Warren cottage
now, and wait till to-morrow before doing anything.
It isn&rsquo;t going to rain to-night, and the stuff will not
be harmed out here without a covering.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>So they travelled up to the Warren cottage, greatly
to the surprise of the Warren boys, who had gone to
bed and were sound asleep when they got there, and
greatly to the concern of good Mrs. Warren, whose
indignation did more to comfort them than anything
else in the world could have. There was always room
for more in the spacious old cottage, and they were
soon stowed away in bed, quickly forgetting their
troubles in sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right here for the rest of the summer,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Warren the next morning at breakfast.
&ldquo;You can bring your camp stuff up and store it in
the shed, and I guess it will be safe there from Jack
Harvey or anybody else. It&rsquo;s a crying shame, but
you&rsquo;re welcome here, so don&rsquo;t feel too bad about it.
I don&rsquo;t think the boys will be sorry to have you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried the Warren boys, in
chorus. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll get that tent yet, I think,&rdquo; said
George Warren. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Jack Harvey would
dare destroy it. He&rsquo;s got it hidden somewhere, depend
upon it. And we must find out where that
place is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe it,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid his experience with our box taught him a lesson.
It is my belief that he has taken the tent and sunk it
out in the bay, weighted with stones, so it will never
come to light. However, we will start out after breakfast
to see if any one in the village saw him or his
crew anywhere near the tent while we were away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The search through the village for a clue proved,
unfortunately, as fruitless as Tom had feared. Not a
soul had seen Harvey or any one of his crew about
the camp during the evening, nor, for that matter,
anybody else. The disappearance remained as mysterious
as though the wind had borne the tent away
out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say the word,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, when he heard
of it, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go over to Mayville and get warrants
for the whole crew. We&rsquo;ll have them up and examine
every one of them. We can&rsquo;t have things of that sort
going on around this village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;At least, not
yet awhile. I don&rsquo;t like to suspect Harvey or any of
his crew of actually stealing the tent. It may be they
have taken it just to annoy us for a night or two, and
we shall get it back again. I&rsquo;d rather take it as a
practical joke for a few days, at any rate, than to have
any boy arrested. I can&rsquo;t believe they would steal
it for good, intending to keep it. Let&rsquo;s wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see your tent, then, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo;
said Captain Sam, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t believe Harvey has the
least idea of bringing it back. And the longer we wait
the harder it will be catching him. However, do as
you think best. I&rsquo;ll go down to-morrow and look
their camp over, anyway, on my own hook. I have
the right to do that. I&rsquo;m a constable, and I&rsquo;ll look
their camp over on general principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find anything, I fear,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; said George Warren, as they all sat
around the open fire that evening, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t been
on a cruise for a long time. What do you say to
starting out in the <i>Spray</i> to-morrow for a trip around
the island? It will take one, two, or three days, according
to the wind, and Henry Burns says he can
go. We&rsquo;ll take along a fly-tent and some blankets,
and part of us can sleep on shore, so we won&rsquo;t be
crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;It comes in a good time
for us, when we&rsquo;re without a home&mdash;oh, I didn&rsquo;t
mean that,&rdquo; he added, hastily, as Mrs. Warren looked
reproachfully at him. &ldquo;This is a better home than
our camp was, to be sure. I mean, while our affairs
are so upset, while we don&rsquo;t know whether we shall
be camping to-morrow or living here. It may help
to straighten matters out, and, if by chance Harvey
and his crew feel like putting the tent back, this will
give them the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll get the lines ready,&rdquo; said George.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of small cod at the foot of the island,&mdash;and
we might take a run across to the islands below,
where there&rsquo;s lots of bigger ones. We&rsquo;ll plan to be
gone two days or a week, just as it happens, and put
in plenty of flour and biscuit and some canned stuff,
in case we can&rsquo;t get fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How happens it that Henry Burns can get off
so easily?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ve let up on him a good deal since the
capture of Craigie,&rdquo; answered George. &ldquo;Now that
the papers have said so much about him and the rest
of us, and the people at the hotel have made so much
of him, Mrs. Carlin has come to the conclusion that
he isn&rsquo;t so much of a helpless child as she thought he
was. She lets him do pretty much as he likes now,
and so Colonel Witham don&rsquo;t bother him, either. He
will be over by and by, and we&rsquo;ll make sure he can go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Henry Burns put in an appearance soon after, and
the subject of the voyage was duly discussed in all
its phases, and settled. The next forenoon found them
all aboard the little yacht <i>Spray</i>, getting everything
shipshape and storing away some provisions and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though we were going on a long voyage,&rdquo;
said young Joe, as his eyes rested fondly on
several cans of lunch-tongue and two large mince pies
which Mrs. Warren had generously provided, besides
several tins of beef and a small keg of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;you know, having you
with us to help eat up stuff is equivalent to going on
a long voyage. And then, one never knows on a trip
of this kind when he is going to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was certainly true, if anything ever was.</p>
<p>They made a great point aboard the <i>Spray</i>, these
Warren boys, of having every rope and sail and cleat
in perfect condition; no snarled ropes, no torn canvas,
and no loose bolts nor cleats to give way in a strain;
and they began now, as usual, to see that everything
was in shipshape condition before they cast off from
their moorings and headed out of the harbour.</p>
<p>The little yacht was, therefore, as trim as any craft
could be when they set sail on their voyage, with
Mrs. Warren waving good-bye to them from the front
piazza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never feel as free anywhere in the world as I do
out aboard the <i>Spray</i> on a trip like this,&rdquo; said George
Warren, stretching himself out comfortably on the
house of the cabin, while Arthur held the tiller. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the best fun there is down here, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, a canoe isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; said
Bob. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take so many, to be sure, but when
Tom and I get off on that and go down among the
islands for a day or two, sleeping underneath it on
the beaches at night and cooking on the shore as we
go along, we feel pretty much like Crusoes ourselves,
eh, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we do,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the next
best thing, surely, to sailing a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Tom,&rdquo; asked Arthur, &ldquo;where did
you leave the canoe? Not where any one could get
that, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s safe and snug,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
locked up in your shed, and your mother has the key.
That&rsquo;s one thing we shall find all right when we get
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind was blowing lightly from the northwest,
and, as they were starting out to make the circuit
of the island by way of the northern end first, they
had to beat their way up along the coast against a
head wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little boat isn&rsquo;t such a bad sailer,&rdquo; said George
Warren, admiringly, gazing aloft at a snug setting
topsail. &ldquo;For a boat of its size, I guess she goes
to windward as well as any. There&rsquo;s only one thing
the matter with her. She&rsquo;s small, and when she&rsquo;s
reefed down under three reefs, with the choppy seas
we have in this bay, she don&rsquo;t work well to windward,
and that&rsquo;s a fault that might be dangerous, if there
were not so many harbours around this coast to run
to in a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose some day we&rsquo;ll have a bigger one, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; queried Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we can earn it, father says,&rdquo; replied
George. &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t look so easy, though. A fellow
can&rsquo;t earn much when he&rsquo;s studying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that up there on the ledges?&rdquo; interrupted
young Joe, pointing ahead to some long reefs that
barely projected above the surface of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are seals&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; replied Arthur.
&ldquo;The wind is right, and we&rsquo;ll sail close up on to them
before they know it. We can&rsquo;t shoot, because we
haven&rsquo;t any gun aboard, but we&rsquo;ll just take them by
surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little <i>Spray</i>, running its nose quietly past the
point of the first ledge and sailing through a channel
sown with the rocks on either hand, came as a surprise
to a colony of the sleek creatures, sunning themselves
on the dry part of the ledges. They floundered clumsily
off the rocks and splashed into the water, like a
lot of schoolboys caught playing hookey, and only
when the whole pack had slipped off into the sea did
they utter a sound, a series of short, sharp barks, as
here and there a curious head bobbed up for a moment,
and then dived quickly below again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have as much curiosity as a human being,&rdquo;
said George Warren. &ldquo;Just watch them steal those
quick glances at us, and then bob under water again.
The fishermen around here shoot them whenever they
get a chance, because they eat the salmon out of the
nets, but I never could bear to take a shot at one.
They seem so intelligent, like a lot of tame dogs. I
don&rsquo;t believe in shooting creatures much, anyway,
unless you want them for food, or unless they are wild,
savage animals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t apply to ducks, I hope,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;We want to take you up into the woods with us
some fall, and have you do some shooting of that
kind,&mdash;ducks and partridges and perhaps a deer or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d like that first rate,&rdquo; answered George.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this senseless shooting of creatures that you don&rsquo;t
want after they are shot that I don&rsquo;t believe in. I
don&rsquo;t believe in shooting things just for the sake of
killing them. Actual hunting in the woods for game
that you live on is another thing. It&rsquo;s a healthful,
vigorous sport that takes one into clean surroundings
and does one good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They chatted on, discussing this and that, till the
yacht at length turned the head of the island and ran
along past Bryant&rsquo;s Cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t forget that harbour in a hurry,&rdquo; they
said, as they sailed by.</p>
<p>The wind was gradually dying down with the sun,
and would not carry them much farther that night,
though they were soon running before it, as they
rounded the uppermost point and headed away for the
foot of the island, some thirteen miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have just about wind enough to run along
to Dave Benson&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s two miles
down, but the wind and tide are both in our favour,&mdash;what
there is of them. We can buy some green
corn of Dave, and he will let us pull his lobster-pots
and charge us only five cents for each lobster. Things
are cheap down here, if you buy them of the fishermen.
A little money means a good deal to them. A little
flour and tea and sugar at the village store, and they
live mighty comfortably on what they catch and what
they raise on their farms. They don&rsquo;t know what it
means to be poor, as the poor in our city do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they live a happy life, for the most part,&rdquo;
said Henry Burns. &ldquo;They get a good share of their
living out of the sea, and I&rsquo;ve always noticed that
seafaring people are generally very well contented
with their lot. You never hear them grumbling, as
men do that work hard on farms. The sea seems to
inspire them more; at least, it seems so to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;inspire&rsquo; mean, please, Henry?&rdquo;
queried young Joe, winking at Bob. &ldquo;It sounds like
a very nice word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspiration means a strong desire and ambition
to do something, and a conviction that one cannot
fail,&rdquo; answered Henry Burns. &ldquo;For instance, I might
feel myself inspired to knock an idea into your head,
just like this.&rdquo; And Henry Burns administered a
sound cuff on that young gentleman&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a very crude example,&rdquo; added Henry Burns. &ldquo;Perhaps
I can give you a better one, if you would like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; said young Joe. &ldquo;That will
do very well for the present. I think I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave Benson&rsquo;s place was a weather-beaten old house
set in the midst of a corn and bean patch, close by a
little creek that ran in from the western bay. It had
an air of dilapidation, but, withal, of comfort about it.
There was a little garden, some hake were drying on
flakes beyond the house, a rowboat and a dory were
pulled up on the beach a little way up the creek, and
the indispensable sailboat, built by Dave himself in
the winter months, was lying a little offshore in the
shelter of a projecting hook of land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, Dave,&rdquo; shouted George Warren, as a tall,
sunburned figure, gaunt but powerful, emerged from
the door of the house and peered out across the water
at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa,&rdquo; he said, laconically. &ldquo;You all ain&rsquo;t been
over much to see us lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we thought we would make a call to-day,&rdquo;
said George. &ldquo;Will you come out and get us? We
left the tender behind. We&rsquo;re going around the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the man shoved his dory off the beach,
stepped in, and sculled out to them with one oar out
over the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb in here sort of easy like, now,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I guess I can take the whole of you ashore
at one load. If you two ain&rsquo;t used to this craft,&rdquo;
he added, addressing Tom and Bob, &ldquo;you want to
look out some, for its tippery and no mistake, though
there ain&rsquo;t no better boat when you know how to
behave in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s something like our canoe,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to that, so I think we&rsquo;ll manage. Perhaps
you never saw a canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know of,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;Though
I do recall seeing what I thought must be one, from
what I&rsquo;ve heard, going along the shore down below
here about an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been a canoe,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;for
ours is the only one on the island, and that is locked
up safe at home in the Warren&rsquo;s shed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe not,&rdquo; replied Dave Benson. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sure
at all. I just noticed there was two boys in it, and
they were on their knees and pushing it along with
what you call paddles, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Bob looked at each other blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be possible,&rdquo; said Tom, at length. &ldquo;I
left ours locked up safe enough. Dave&rsquo;s made a
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any corn?&rdquo; asked Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s some growing out there, I reckon.
You can go out and pick what you want and gimme
what you like for it. It&rsquo;s good and sweet, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lobsters, how about them?&rdquo; asked young
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t pulled the pots to-day,&rdquo; said Dave.
&ldquo;You can go and do that, too, I reckon. There
ought to be some there. I baited them all fresh with
cunners and sculpins last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go and pull them,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I never
caught a lobster. Come on, Joe, you can show me
how and I&rsquo;ll do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever handle a dory?&rdquo; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Bob, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m used to a canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you ever pull a lobster-pot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never saw one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you want to look out,&rdquo; said Dave, and took
himself off into his house, leaving the boys to themselves.</p>
<p>Bob got another oar, and, with young Joe in the
stern, rowed out a few rods toward some ledges,
where Dave had indicated that the lobster-pots were
set.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever pull a lobster-pot, Joe?&rdquo; asked
Bob, as they came in sight of half a dozen small
wooden buoys, about as big as ten-pins, floating at a
short distance from one another, with ropes attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did,&rdquo; replied Joe; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve seen
it done and it looks easy. You just lift the pot aboard
the boat and open a trap-door and take out the lobsters.
Only you want to look out how you take hold
of one of them, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s all right if you take
him by the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On shore, seated on a huge stick of timber, washed
ashore long ago and half-imbedded in the sand, the
other boys watched the proceedings with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob will do it all right, of course,&rdquo; said George,
winking slyly at Arthur. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple enough trick,
only it is harder in a dory than in a boat with a keel
to it, for a dory slides off so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like a canoe,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is a lobster-pot heavy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the deceptive part of it,&rdquo; replied George.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great big cage made of laths with a bottom
of boards, and it comes to the surface easy because
the water buoys it up. It&rsquo;s the lifting it out that fools
one. It&rsquo;s got three or four big stones in it to weigh
it down, and you have got to bring it out of water
with a sudden lift or it will stick half-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bob, having grasped one of the
floating buoys, proceeded to haul in the slack of the
rope, which was quite long, to allow for the tide,
which was now low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It comes up easy,&rdquo; he said to Joe, as he drew
it up slowly to the surface, hand over hand. &ldquo;Here
she comes now. Wait till it lands on the gunwale and
then lean over on the other side, so we won&rsquo;t capsize.&rdquo;
Bob grasped the slats of the big cage and lifted manfully.</p>
<p>The lobster-pot came up all right, as George had
explained, till, just at the point where it should have
left the water, it stopped suddenly and stuck like a
bar of lead. Unluckily, Bob had not counted on that
extra weight of stone inside, nor on the loss of the
buoyancy of the water. At the same instant, moreover,
young Joe, seeing the cage strike the gunwale,
shifted over to the other side of the dory. This settled
the matter. The pot lodged half-way over one
gunwale, hung there for a moment, long enough to
careen the crank thing down on its side; Bob and
Joe both lost their balance and slid the same way,
the dory filled with water, and boys and lobster-pot
slumped into the sea.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">

<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;BOYS AND LOBSTER-POT SLUMPED INTO THE SEA&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>The boys on shore set up a roar at the mishap of
their comrades, while long Dave Benson, emerging
once more from his cabin door, was heard to chuckle
as he strode down to the shore and shoved off his
rowboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a canoe, exactly,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;just
like it&mdash;only it&rsquo;s so different.&rdquo; And he doubled up
at the oars and laughed silently.</p>
<p>Bob and Joe, coming to the surface, puffing and
blowing water, were pleased to note the sympathy
displayed for them in four boyish forms, rolling off
the log and holding on to their sides with laughter.
Nor did the keenness of this sympathy abate the whole
evening long, for every now and then one of them
might be heard to repeat the language of Dave Benson,
as he glanced significantly at the others, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
like a canoe&mdash;only it&rsquo;s so different.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>However, Bob and Joe, being duly scrubbed down
and invested in a change of duck clothing from the
locker of the <i>Spray</i>, did not relish any the less the
supper that awaited them, of broiled live lobster,
cooked over a glowing bed of coals on the beach, and
corn that was as sweet as Dave Benson had promised.
They took their chaffing as good fellows and comrades
are bound to do, only vowing inwardly to bide
their time for revenge.</p>
<p>Then, as night was coming on, they set up their
fly-tent on a clean, dry part of the beach, well beyond
the reach of the tide, spread down their blankets, and
Tom and Bob and Henry Burns turned in to sleep
there, leaving the little cabin of the <i>Spray</i> for the
Warren boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;did you hear what Dave Benson
said as he brought in the capsized dory, with the
lobsters, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was &lsquo;just like a canoe, only&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dry up, Tom,&rdquo; exclaimed Bob. &ldquo;Your
turn will come next, so don&rsquo;t rub it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went off soundly to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, when they awoke, they found
that the wind had altered and was beginning to blow up
from the southward. They must, therefore, beat their
way down to the foot of the island, some ten miles
distant, against a head wind and sea, for a southerly
always rolled in more or less of a sea after it had
blown for an hour or so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come again,&rdquo; called out Dave Benson, as they
left his cabin astern, and he stood waving them farewell
with his weather-beaten hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to know what he meant when he
said he saw a canoe out here,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I know
ours is all right, but he certainly did describe a canoe,
when he spoke about its being paddled, and ours is
the only one I know of around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he saw it last night, or, rather, yesterday
afternoon,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;and nobody would have
disturbed ours in broad daylight, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But about an hour later, they came suddenly to the
conclusion that Dave Benson knew what he was talking
about, when Henry Burns exclaimed all at once:
&ldquo;Why, there it is now. Dave Benson was right,
after all. That&rsquo;s a canoe, down about a mile ahead,
just off that white line of beach, and there are two
paddling it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked in amazement. There could be no
mistaking it. Henry Burns had surely spied a canoe.
They could make it out quite plainly, pitching slightly
in the sea, with apparently some one at either end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, get the glass, Joe,&rdquo; cried George Warren,
who had the tiller. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the locker in the cabin,
you know. That will show us just who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Joe dived below and reappeared the next
instant, bringing a small telescope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, handing it to Tom, &ldquo;take a look
at them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Tom adjusted the focus of the glass and sighted
the craft ahead, then exclaimed, excitedly: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
them, sure enough. It&rsquo;s Harvey and Joe Hinman and
it&rsquo;s the canoe. We&rsquo;ve got them, too, if the <i>Spray</i> can
only catch them. We&rsquo;re sure to get the canoe, at
any rate, for they can&rsquo;t run far or fast with that on
their shoulders, if they see us and take to the shore.
We know what it is to try to hurry with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we do,&rdquo; returned Bob. &ldquo;Let me have a
look, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracky!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he put the glass down
almost as soon as he had sighted it. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have
thought they would have had the nerve to get that
in broad daylight? They must know they are sure to
be seen in it, too. What on earth can Harvey be
thinking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll set the club topsail and the other jib in a
hurry,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;and perhaps we can overhaul
them before they see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got the extra sail on in a twinkling and
laid the course of the <i>Spray</i> a little closer into the
wind. Fifteen minutes went by, and they had made
rapid progress in overhauling the canoe. They made
short tacks, so as not to be seen by the paddlers, if
possible, by keeping so far as they could in a line
with the stern of the canoe.</p>
<p>Presently, however, the boy who was wielding the
stern paddle turned and looked back, and they could
see plainly that it was Harvey.</p>
<p>He must have seen them, too, and been vastly surprised,
for, carrying across the strip of land at the
Narrows, he had surely expected to meet no familiar
yacht in the western bay. The occupants of the canoe
turned their craft more in toward shore, though not
directly, and, at least so it seemed to the boys, began
paddling desperately, as though they hoped to escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>If they had thought they could run away from the
<i>Spray</i> in this way, they soon found out their mistake,
for the Spray continued rapidly to overhaul them.</p>
<p>Turning squarely in toward the shore, Harvey and
Joe Hinman soon reached it, jumped out, and drew
the canoe far up on the beach. Their next move
surprised the crew of the Spray. Leaving the canoe
in full sight on the beach, Harvey and Joe Hinman
walked deliberately away, without so much as looking
back at their pursuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mighty strange performance,&rdquo; exclaimed
George Warren. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no place to run the <i>Spray</i> in close to
shore, so they rounded to some thirty feet out, and
Tom and Bob, hastily throwing off their clothes,
dived overboard and swam to the beach.</p>
<p>Tom was the first to reach the canoe; but, as he
came upon it and turned it over, he uttered a cry of
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve fooled us this time, sure enough,&rdquo; he
said to Bob, who came panting up. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t our
canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoe, in fact, was new.</p>
<p>It was enough like theirs to be its mate, both as
to size and colour, but there was not a scratch upon
it nor upon the paddles. The canoe could not have
been used more than once or twice since it had left
the maker&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The joke is on us,&rdquo; cried Bob to the boys in the
<i>Spray</i>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another canoe. Harvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;governor,&rsquo;
as he calls him, must have bought it for him and sent
it down on the boat yesterday. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be afraid to trust us with his property, which is more
than we would do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he would rather trust the canoe with us
than to trust himself with all of us just at this time,&rdquo;
replied Tom. &ldquo;I feel like taking it along with us,
to make him give up our tent, but I&rsquo;m afraid that
wouldn&rsquo;t do. We can&rsquo;t prove that he has it, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey and Joe Hinman had clearly left the canoe
to its fate, so there was nothing to do but to swim
aboard the <i>Spray</i> again, and the voyage down the
island was resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing about it,&rdquo; said Tom, as he
scrambled into his clothing once more, &ldquo;if Jack Harvey
is as reckless and as careless in that canoe as he
is in his yacht it will be washed up on shore some
day without him. Not that I hope it will happen,
but I look to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was born to be drowned,&rdquo; said
Henry Burns.</p>
<p>Toward noon they came in sight of the southern
extremity of the island, or the extremities, to speak
more accurately, for the end of the island here was
divided into a succession of thin points of land of
various shapes, affording a number of small, rockbound
harbours, snug and secluded, and each making
good shelter for small vessels.</p>
<p>They selected one of these, and, as they knew the
waters to be filled with a species of small cod, they
determined to lay up here for the afternoon and night,
starting out again the next morning. They brought
the <i>Spray</i> well in to the head of the harbour which
they selected, so that it was almost wholly land-locked
when they dropped anchor and furled their
sails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Toward evening the wind decreased, dying out
almost entirely. Big banks of clouds piling up in the
northwest told them that they might expect the breeze
from that quarter in the morning.</p>
<p>It was getting dusk and they were cooking their
supper in the little cabin of the <i>Spray</i>, when young
Joe, looking out of the companionway, exclaimed:
&ldquo;Why, here comes company; another yacht&rsquo;s going
to lie in here for the night, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking out, they saw a big black sloop coming
slowly into the harbour. She had come up from the
southward before the wind, and had only her mainsail
set. There was hardly breeze enough to bring
her in. She drifted in slowly, with one man at her
wheel, and, as she came within hailing distance, young
Joe, going forward, swung his cap and shouted,
&ldquo;Ahoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man at the wheel did not respond, but, strangely
enough, at the sound of young Joe&rsquo;s voice the yacht
slowly turned again, heading completely about, and
stood out of the harbour again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem to like our company,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;ll have to have it, whether he wants it
or not,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not wind
enough to take him out again, as he will find when
he gets the set of the tide at the entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>If the helmsman aboard the strange yacht had
really intended to quit the harbour again, he found
the tide to be as George Warren had said. After
vainly trying to make out for a few moments, he
left the wheel, ran forward, and the next moment
they heard the splash of his anchor. Then the sail
dropped and the man went below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever they are aboard there, they don&rsquo;t seem
inclined to be sociable,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;Well,
they don&rsquo;t have to be, if they don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;re afraid we&rsquo;ll keep them awake,&rdquo; said
George Warren. &ldquo;They are fishermen, by the looks.
See, she carries no topmast, so she is not a pleasure
yacht, though she looks from here like a fast boat.
They make them good models now, since Burgess
began it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Arthur Warren. &ldquo;Those
fishermen like to sleep nights, after a hard day&rsquo;s
work, without being disturbed. I remember one night
we laid up in a harbour and began singing college
songs, and a crew of them rowed over to us and
threatened to lick us if we didn&rsquo;t keep quiet. This
fellow doesn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hail him, anyway, if he comes on deck again,&rdquo;
said Henry Burns, &ldquo;and find out where he is from.
I like to know my neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man aboard the strange yacht was not inclined
to be neighbourly. He did not appear on deck
again. A thin wreath of smoke curled out of the
funnel in his cabin, and they knew he was getting a
meal. That was the only sign of life aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Sometime that night&mdash;he did not know the hour&mdash;Henry
Burns awoke, conscious of some sound that
had disturbed his light slumbers. Presently he became
aware that it was the sound of a sail being
hoisted. Getting up softly without disturbing his
companions, he crept out of the cabin and looked
across the water. The moon was shining, and he could
see a lone figure aboard the strange yacht, getting the
boat under way.</p>
<p>Henry Burns saw him go forward and labour for
awhile at the anchor rope. Then, for a wind had
arisen, the man ran aft to the wheel, and Henry Burns
saw the strange yacht go sailing out of the harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer thing to do,&rdquo; muttered Henry
Burns. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about it. He
tried to get out before, the minute he saw us. Cracky!
You don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&mdash; No, that&rsquo;s nonsense. I&rsquo;m getting
altogether too suspicious ever since I came across
that man Craigie upon the roof of the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Henry Burns went back to his bunk again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">STORM DRIVEN</span></h2>
<p>When they awoke next morning the wind
was blowing heavily from the northwest,
and, while the sun was as yet shining
brightly, the sky was darkened here and there with
banks of clouds, which moved with great rapidity,
driven by violent currents. Inside the snug harbour
the water was calm, but, looking out beyond on the
bay, they could see its surface broken already into
big waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a nasty day outside,&rdquo; remarked George
Warren. &ldquo;I wonder whether we ought to lie in here
to-day, or take the chance of clearing the foot of the
island before it gets heavier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to stay here another whole day,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s going to blow much harder,
George?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for certain,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but
it looks as though the wind was going to increase
right along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think we could get around the foot
of the island before it got much worse?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
&ldquo;There is only about a mile to run before
we get under the lee of the islands in the other
bay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if we can reach the eastern bay all
right, we shall be in smooth water then,&rdquo; said George,
&ldquo;for the island will shut off the wind to a great
extent, and there won&rsquo;t be much sea. Well, if you
fellows are willing to take the chance, I am. I guess
it won&rsquo;t get any worse than the night we ran to
Bryant&rsquo;s Cove. The <i>Spray</i> stood that all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast being finished, they double-reefed the
mainsail of the little yacht, and did not set the jib, as
they would be running with the wind about on their
quarter and would not need it. Then they stood out
of the harbour into the bay.</p>
<p>They were almost immediately in rough water, and
the very first plunge of the yacht into the heavy sea
sent the spray flying over them. Young Joe and
Arthur went scurrying into the cabin for the oilskins,
of which they had a good supply, and the boys prepared
themselves for wet weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it right along now,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;until
we can clear that point about a mile ahead there.
The <i>Spray</i> does the best she can, but she does throw
the water bad in a heavy sea. It isn&rsquo;t her fault. And
there&rsquo;s one good thing about her; you can&rsquo;t tip her
over. She will stand up till the mast and sail are
blown out of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys now realized how deceptive wind and
water viewed from a distance always are. Gusts of
wind that were seen from shore to blacken the water
and send the spray flying from the crests of waves,
were found now to be of far greater violence than
they had supposed. Viewed from the harbour, the
waves had not seemed to be of unusual size, but, now
that they threw the little yacht about like a toy, they
assumed a more terrific aspect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>The wind increased, and the <i>Spray</i> rolled dangerously
in the seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stand this,&rdquo; said George, at length.
&ldquo;We have got to put the third reef in and do it
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got the yacht into the wind for a moment,
lowered the sail, and tied in a few reef-points; but
the yacht would not hold in the wind, and they had
to be content with a few knots tied at twice or three
times the usual distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re blowing offshore at a great rate,&rdquo; exclaimed
George, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help it. I can&rsquo;t hold
her up any higher. She won&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we cannot make the point,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; returned George. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like the prospect of getting out into that bay, either,
but I&rsquo;m afraid we are in for it. I had no idea there
was any such a sea running, nor anything like this
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospect was, indeed, not encouraging. Across
the wide stretch of bay for some eighteen miles the
sea was one mass of whitecaps, a tumbling confusion
of waves, which already broke aboard the yacht, covering
the boys with spray and necessitating the use
of bailing-dish and boat-sponge to keep the water
from standing in the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get that topping-lift up higher,
Arthur,&rdquo; said George Warren, as the yacht rolled
heavily, bringing the boom down dangerously near
the waves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>His brother sprang to the halyards at the warning,
but it was a moment too late. At that instant
a wave, rolling higher than any they had yet encountered,
raised the <i>Spray</i> on its crest and hurled
it forward, at the same time causing the little craft
to yaw so that the boom was buried for a moment
deep in the seas. That moment was enough. There
was a sharp snap as the boom, splintered in two in
the middle, emerged from the waves, a useless thing.
The yacht nearly broached to, while the next oncoming
wave broke fairly aboard, filling the cockpit half-full
of water.</p>
<p>They thought it was all over with them then, but
they kept their heads and saved themselves. Henry
Burns and Arthur Warren, at the risk of going overboard,
managed to get the broken boom aboard, after
they had let the halyards run, and lashed it astern,
so that the yacht was utterly without sail. At
the same time Tom and Bob, who knew little about
handling a yacht, but were ready for any emergency,
bailed furiously with pails to clear the boat of water.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the hatch had been shut, and the deluge
of water had not gone into the cabin, or the boat
must have foundered. As it was, she rolled heavily
till they had bailed the cockpit dry again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does settle it, with a vengeance,&rdquo; said George
Warren, when they had recovered a little from the
shock. &ldquo;We have got to run for it now, clear across
this bay. I think we can do it all right, but you
fellows will have to bail lively. That won&rsquo;t be the
only sea we take aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we run to?&rdquo; asked Henry Burns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; replied George Warren.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, by any means, whether we get blown
out to the shoals, or whether we can head over to
the eastward any, ever so slightly, and strike the Gull
Island Thoroughfare. If we can land under the lee
of Gull Island, we may be able to do something. The
first thing, though, is to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy thing to hold the yacht on its course,
even with no sail to drive it up to windward. Every
wave threatened to throw it broadside on, and it required
now and again the united efforts of George
and Arthur Warren to steady it. Then a wave would
come aboard astern, rolling in and nearly filling the
cockpit. Several times it did this, and at each and
every time it seemed as though the little yacht was
going down. They bailed desperately then, every one
of them falling to except George Warren.</p>
<p>To their credit, though, not one of them lost his
courage. Their faces were drawn and set, but they
had confidence that the little <i>Spray</i> would somehow
bring them through.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon they had got
the Thoroughfare well in sight, big Gull Island lying
nearly dead ahead and the smaller Gull Islands lying
away to the eastward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can manage to get a scrap of sail on her
just as we pass the end of Gull Island,&rdquo; said George
Warren, &ldquo;I think we can swing her in and not capsize.
We&rsquo;ve got to keep headway on, though, or one
of these big rollers will get under us and tip us over.
We shall have a few rods to run broadside on, for,
as we are running now, and the best we can head, we
cannot come nearer than that to the island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her a scrap of sail that she can carry,&rdquo;
exclaimed Arthur, and dived into the companionway,
shutting the door quickly to keep the seas out. He
returned in a moment, bringing a hand-saw. With
this he severed clean the broken half of the boom,
tying the ends of the rigging to the short stub that
was left. This left the sail a huge, clumsy bag, that
would evidently not hoist up but a foot or so on the
mast, but might possibly be of some service in the
emergency.</p>
<p>A torrent of rain now began to pour, falling so
dense as almost to shut out the islands ahead. Their
outlines became obscured, making the effort to run
into the Thoroughfare a more difficult and dangerous
one. Moreover, the wind continued to increase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows,&rdquo; said George Warren, as they
came abreast of the end of Big Gull Island, &ldquo;everybody
up to windward and hold on hard. She&rsquo;s going
to lay over when she gets these seas broadside. Hoist
the sail, Arthur, just as we begin to head in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur sprang to the halyards, but they were tangled
and did not pull true. Try as best he could, the
sail would hoist but a little ways on the mast. It
bagged out like a huge balloon, holding the wind and
nearly capsizing them. Henry Burns, handling the
main-sheet, let it run just in time to save them. Still
the sail gave them headway, and, carefully managed,
would answer to fetch them in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Twice they had to head off fairly before the wind
again, at the onrush of some enormous wave, but
they got quickly on their course again, and, rolling
frightfully, with the boys clinging far out to windward,
the little yacht all at once felt the relief which
the sheltering extremity of Gull Island afforded from
the awful strain. Almost before they knew it, they
were in smooth water once more, riding easily at the
entrance to the Thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; cried George Warren, as he dropped
the tiller and shook his hands, which were numb and
aching from the strain and the cold rain. &ldquo;That was
a ride for life that I don&rsquo;t care to repeat again in a
hurry. Didn&rsquo;t the little <i>Spray</i> do well, though, eh,
Arthur? She had a good excuse to founder if she
hadn&rsquo;t been staunch. If she was only a little larger
she wouldn&rsquo;t have minded this at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did come flying across that bay and no mistake,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;I thought we were going to
founder twice or three times, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though we were stranded here for some
days, that&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; said George Warren.
&ldquo;This storm has just begun, by the looks of it. It&rsquo;s
a lonesome hole, too, down in this reach. Nobody
ever comes here, except a few fishermen in the fall
and spring. The Thoroughfare is all right, but it
doesn&rsquo;t lead to any particular place in the course of
vessels, so it isn&rsquo;t a regular thoroughfare really, like
those over to the eastward more. Now and then a
yacht goes through, just for the sail, but one has got
to know the channel very well, for it isn&rsquo;t charted
accurately,&mdash;at least, so Cap&rsquo;n Sam says.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Arthur, &ldquo;we are not making a race
against time, so I don&rsquo;t see as it matters much whether
we stay here or some other part of the bay. We&rsquo;ll
just lie snug aboard here to-night, and then to-morrow
we&rsquo;ll get out and explore. There are some fishermen&rsquo;s
shanties around on the other side of some of those
smaller islands, and we ought to be able to build up
a fire in one of them and live there till the storm is
over, so we won&rsquo;t have to stay in this little cabin all
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad enough to go down there for awhile
now,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, &ldquo;and get dry and warm.
Come on, Bob, let&rsquo;s you and me start some coffee and
biscuit going. You do the cooking, because you know
how, and I&rsquo;ll look on. I&rsquo;ll get the dishes out, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was scarcely room in the cabin of the <i>Spray</i>
for more than four of them to sit and eat, so they
threw the mainsail over the stub of the boom and
made a shelter out of it against the rain. There, just
outside the cabin, Tom and Bob sat as they all ate
supper, with the rain pouring down all around and
spattering in under the edges of the canvas. It was
uncomfortable and dreary at best, and they were all
glad when time came to turn in, which they did by all
crowding into the cabin, where they could at least
keep dry, although stowed away like sardines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; exclaimed Henry Burns, as he awoke
next morning, feeling stiff and sore. &ldquo;I feel as
though I was creased and starched and ironed, and
every time I move I take out a crease. It will take
me half a day to straighten out again, I&rsquo;ve got so
many kinks in my neck and back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>They were all cramped and lame from the uncomfortable
positions in which they had lain, for on
fair nights they had been accustomed to make up
two bunks just outside the cabin, in the cockpit. It
was still raining hard, but as soon as they had had
breakfast they set out to seek for new quarters.</p>
<p>With the scrap of a sail set, and with the use of
the sweeps with which the yacht was provided, they
worked their way about a quarter of a mile along
into the Thoroughfare, till they got abreast of one
of the smaller of the Gull Islands. The shores of this
were very bold, the rocks going down sheer, without
any outlying reefs or ledges, so that they were able
to run the yacht close alongside, making her fast at
bow and stern with ropes carried out on land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems good to stretch one&rsquo;s legs again,&rdquo; said
Bob, as they all sprang out on to the rocks. They
were indeed glad to be on land once more.</p>
<p>The island on which they now were was about
three-quarters of a mile long and about half a mile
wide, quite densely wooded with a growth of spruce
and young birches. From a little elevation they could
look out to sea toward the southward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shanties are on the other side, if I remember
rightly,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;I was down here
once in the fishing season. We may as well strike
directly across to the south shore. That&rsquo;s where the
fishermen build their weirs for the salmon that run
in along the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>They tramped across through the woods in the
pouring rain. It was a relief to get even the shelter
that the trees afforded from the driving storm. Presently
they came in sight of the fishermen&rsquo;s cabins, a
cluster of four standing in a clearing at the edge of
the woods, facing the sea. One of the huts was somewhat
larger than the other three, and toward this
they directed their steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just like to break into other people&rsquo;s
property,&rdquo; said George Warren, advancing toward the
door, hatchet in hand, &ldquo;but it only means forcing a
staple, and we can replace that without any harm being
done. It&rsquo;s the only&mdash;hulloa! Why, somebody&rsquo;s
been here before us. The door is ajar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody had, indeed, forced the door, and had
not taken pains to refasten it. The staple, which had
been drawn, lay on the ground by the door, just where
it had been dropped. The boys threw open the door
and stepped inside.</p>
<p>The one room, for a shanty of the kind, was fairly
commodious. Along the two ends were ranged tiers
of bunks, three at either end, making just enough for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though they were built expressly for us,&rdquo;
remarked Henry Burns.</p>
<p>The bunks were rough, clumsily made affairs, a
few boards knocked together, with a thin layer of
hay thrown in at the bottom of each; but with the
blankets from the yacht they would be comfortable.</p>
<p>In the centre of the room was a large sheet-iron
stove, with a funnel running up through the roof. In
one corner of the room&mdash;there was only one room
in the cabin&mdash;was a sort of cupboard, on the shelves
of which were piled a few tin dishes. A rusty axe
was apparently the only tool left on the premises.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>There was a scrap of kindling and one or two dry
sticks of wood beside the stove, and with this they
started a fire. Driftwood lined the shore, and a number
of dead spruces, which had not yet rotted, furnished
them with an ample supply of fuel. They
piled the stove full, and soon had a fire roaring that
turned the stove red-hot and which sent out a grateful
warmth throughout the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will dry us out in good shape,&rdquo; exclaimed
Arthur, as the steam came from his wet clothing.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have this old shanty as comfortable as a
parlour. This is a better house than Crusoe ever
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a comfortable shelter against the
storm. The roof and sides were shingled, so that it
kept out the rain, and though the wind, which by
this time was blowing a gale, shook it till it rattled,
it stood firm.</p>
<p>After the boys had brought in a supply of firewood,
enough to last them through the evening, and
had stowed it near the stove to dry, they set out
again for the yacht, and brought back each a blanket,
the yacht&rsquo;s two lanterns, and a supply of food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky we put a good supply aboard,&rdquo; said
young Joe, as they stowed the stuff away on the cabin
shelves. &ldquo;Looks as though we were in for a couple
of days here, at least. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been any
fun to have to fish for our suppers in this storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would never have survived it, Joe,&rdquo; returned
Arthur, &ldquo;though you did eat enough at that
picnic to last you several days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; cried Henry Burns,
who had been rummaging about in the cupboard.
&ldquo;The parties who were here before us didn&rsquo;t believe
in starving. And they didn&rsquo;t believe in living on
fishermen&rsquo;s fare, either.&rdquo; And Henry Burns brought
forth three empty wine-bottles and a half-emptied jar
of imported preserves. &ldquo;Here are some tins that
contained turkey and some kinds of game,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;The fishermen don&rsquo;t buy that sort of canned stuff.
It must have been a party of yachtsmen that used this
place last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have had the fairness to fasten the
door after them, whoever they were,&rdquo; said George
Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the wine accounts for that,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they left us some preserves,&rdquo; said young
Joe.</p>
<p>They slept soundly in the shanty that night, with
the wind howling about their ears and the rain dashing
against the single window and beating like mad
upon the roof. Nor did the storm abate the following
day, nor the next night. Not till the third morning
did the sunlight welcome them as they awoke,
but then it poured through every chink and crack
in the shanty, as though to make amends for the
length of its absence.</p>
<p>When the woods had dried sufficiently so they
could venture abroad, they set out to hunt for a
young spruce that would do for a boom for the <i>Spray</i>.
After cutting several and finding they had been deceived
in their length, they finally secured one which
would do. Then they brought up the stub of the
boom from the yacht and got the exact measure of
the old one from the sail, which they disentangled
from the snarl of rigging, and spread out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Captain Sam would laugh at this
spar-making effort of mine,&rdquo; said George Warren, as
he trimmed away at the slender trunk of spruce, from
which he had peeled the bark; &ldquo;but it will do to
take us on our cruise again. And what&rsquo;s the use
of going on a cruise if you don&rsquo;t have adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had fashioned the stick as well as his one
tool&mdash;a hatchet from the locker of the <i>Spray</i>&mdash;would
admit of, he unscrewed the jaws from the old
boom, fastened them upon the new, and the boom
was done.</p>
<p>Then they set about mending several tears in the
mainsail, with a needle and twine, also from the
yacht&rsquo;s locker, and by noon everything was in readiness
for rigging the sail once more. This proved the
most difficult task of all, for they found that it is
one thing to know the running rigging of a sailboat,
and another thing to reeve it when it has been
displaced. It was not until the middle of the afternoon
that they had the job completed, and then, as
the wind was dying out, they decided it was useless
to attempt to set sail till the following morning.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Henry Burns, finding that he was
of no service in the work of rigging the yacht, had
volunteered to get a mess of fish for supper. Accordingly
he set out, equipped with a short alder
pole and line and a basket, to try for some cunners
and small cod off the ledges on the seaward side of
the island. He succeeded in getting a fairly good
catch, and then continued along the shore in search
of mussels, as the tide was several hours ebbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>His search brought him at length to the northernmost
extremity of the island, where he sat down on
the beach to rest. Then, as he started to resume his
walk, he noticed that the receding tide had left bare
a narrow sand-bar, that connected the island on which
the cabins stood and the adjacent island, so that he
could now pass from one to the other almost dry-shod.</p>
<p>Fondness for exploring was ever Henry Burns&rsquo;s
ruling passion, so he set out across the sand-bar to
the neighbouring island, and was pleased to find that
the mussel-beds were far more plenty there than he
had found them before. This island was not so large
as the other Gull Island. It was not more than a
half-mile long and about a quarter of a mile across
in its widest part. It had, however, the same characteristic
of the other, in that its shores were abrupt,
and deep water lay all around it.</p>
<p>There was but one small strip of beach, extending
out into mud-flats, where Henry Burns could gather
mussels; but he soon filled his basket here, and, setting
it down in the shade of an overhanging rock,
climbed the ledge that now barred his way, and started
to make a circuit of the island along the edge of its
steep banks.</p>
<p>Henry Burns had a habit of day-dreaming as he
walked, unless he happened to be in search of some
particular thing, when he was the most alert of youths.
So, as he walked, his mind was far away just then,
back in the town of Medford, where he pictured to
himself familiar objects, and wondered what was
happening there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>So it happened that he passed a certain tree close
by the shore, only half-noticing that the end of a
stout hawser was tied to it, and not paying any attention
to it. When he had gone on a rod or two,
it suddenly struck him that this was an odd thing,
as the hawser was new, and so he went back to look
at it. There was a short length of the rope dangling
from where it had been made fast about the tree-trunk,
and he noticed upon examination that the free
end had been severed cleanly by the stroke of a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;Fishermen
don&rsquo;t usually waste a good piece of hawser like that.
Some one was extravagant and in a hurry, or impatient&mdash;By
Jove! You don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns had lost his preoccupied air in a
moment. Following the line from the rope to the
edge of the bank, he scrambled carefully down over
the face of the ledge to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>Henry Burns was not surprised to discover that
the rock was smeared all over with spots of black
paint. Moreover, if further evidence were needed
that some one had been at work there, there lay in
a niche of the ledge an empty keg in which paint had
been mixed.</p>
<p>But what elated Henry Burns still more was a
discovery he made by a closer examination of the
ledge just under water. There at a depth of from
one to two feet under water were rough, jagged
edges of the rock which had been in contact with
some object&mdash;an object that had left upon their surface
unmistakable smearings or scrapings of paint
which was white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Henry Burns, excitedly, for him.
&ldquo;There it is&mdash;the old and the new. There&rsquo;s where he
rubbed against the ledge as he made fast, and here&rsquo;s
the evidence all about on these rocks of his new disguise.
And there, right close to the bank, are the
trees to which he fastened his tackle. If it isn&rsquo;t just
as Miles Burton said, to the letter, then there&rsquo;s no
trusting one&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns lay flat on a shelving bit of rock, with
his face close to the water, and peered down to the
bed below. The water was not very clear, but he
could discern distinctly a deep, narrow trench in the
hard sand, which might have been made by the keel
of a boat, if the boat had touched bottom at low
water.</p>
<p>Any one observing Henry Burns at this moment
would have been puzzled indeed. He suddenly sprang
up, tore off his jacket and trousers, bared himself in
the quickest possible time, and, poising for one brief
moment on the brink of the water, dived in. He
swam to the bottom with two strokes, clutched at
something that lay on the bottom, grasped it in his
right hand, came to the surface, and, drawing himself
out on land once more, stuffed the object into his
trousers pocket and scrambled into his clothing again,
as though his life depended on his haste. Then he
started on a run for the sand-bar, crossed it, paused
never a moment for his basket of fish and clams, and
dashed back to the shanty as fast as his legs could
carry him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>It was not constitutional with Henry Burns, however,
to continue long in a state of excitement, and by
the time he had regained his companions his composure
had returned. Still, they were familiar enough
with him to perceive that something unusual had
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Henry?&rdquo; exclaimed George
Warren. &ldquo;We saw you running along the beach
up there as if somebody was after you. We didn&rsquo;t
know but what you had found another burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Henry Burns, &ldquo;it was the same
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was their turn now to become excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began George Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; interrupted Henry Burns. &ldquo;Say, do
you remember the strange black yacht that came into
the harbour at the foot of Grand Island the other night,
and that was in such a hurry to get out again when
it saw us? Well, that was Chambers, and the yacht
was the <i>Eagle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but she was black,&rdquo; said George Warren,
&ldquo;and she had no topmast. The <i>Eagle</i> was white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t you recall what Burton said about
Chambers, what a hand he was for changing a yacht
over so she&rsquo;d look like a different craft? Well, that&rsquo;s
what he has done, and I&rsquo;ve found the place where he
did it. There&rsquo;s the white paint back there on the
edges of the rocks where the yacht rubbed alongside,
and the rock is all covered with spots of black
paint.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Henry Burns rapidly recounted what he had discovered,
including the end of hawser made fast to
the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; exclaimed Henry Burns,
triumphantly, as he fished a hand into his right trousers
pocket. &ldquo;See here, what do you make of this?
I saw it shining down in the water just where the
stern of the yacht must have laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns drew forth a glittering object from
his pocket and held it up to their gaze.</p>
<p>It was a gilt letter &ldquo;E.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo; for &lsquo;<i>Eagle</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Henry Burns. &ldquo;This
letter got away from him. It&rsquo;s clear as daylight now.
Say, fellows, let&rsquo;s start for Southport early in the
morning. That man Chambers is in the bay. He&rsquo;s
up to something, and we want to get them after him
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN IN THE BOAT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; said Jack Harvey, one afternoon,
a few days following the return of the <i>Spray</i>
from its cruise, &ldquo;I have decided to enter
that free-for-all race over at Bellport. I&rsquo;ve just
heard that Ed Perkins isn&rsquo;t going to race the <i>Ella</i>,
after all; and, with her out of the race, we stand a
good show. Let&rsquo;s get the stuff aboard and start while
there&rsquo;s a wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll stay here and watch the camp?&rdquo; asked
Allan Harding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;d better, now you speak of it,&rdquo;
responded Harvey, quickly. &ldquo;There ought to be
somebody here, sure. Camps have a way of disappearing
around here, you know, Allan,&rdquo; giving a
huge wink as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as lieve stay, all right,&rdquo; returned Allan,
a little out of humour, in spite of his assurance. &ldquo;But
you can&rsquo;t win the race without me, you know. You
always said I was lucky&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a good deal
of luck in racing, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll try to win without luck, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
said Harvey. &ldquo;And, mind, we depend on you to
have the camp still standing here when we get back.
I shouldn&rsquo;t think it would be nice to get back and
find one&rsquo;s camp gone, eh, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other, shortly.</p>
<p>The crew lost no time in stowing their blankets
and camp-kit aboard the <i>Surprise</i>, and, leaving Allan
Harding sullenly on guard, they sailed away for Bellport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though something was missing thereabouts,&rdquo;
chuckled Harvey, as they sailed past the spot
where Tom&rsquo;s and Bob&rsquo;s camp had stood. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it
strike you there used to be something there that&rsquo;s
gone now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This piece of humour on Harvey&rsquo;s part seemed to
tickle the crew vastly, for they shouted with derision
as they sailed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they must have got tired of camping there,&rdquo;
roared Harvey, at which the others roared the louder.</p>
<p>Bellport, whither they were bound, lay about four
miles down the coast of the mainland below Mayville.
It was not so large a place as Southport, but
was a favourite resort for yachtsmen, as the bay
there was free of islands, and for ten or more miles
there was a good sailing course.</p>
<p>The yacht <i>Surprise</i> did not reach Bellport till late
that night, but Harvey and his crew were up bright
and early the next morning, as the race was to come
off at ten o&rsquo;clock, and they wished to have everything
ready for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, Harvey!&rdquo; called a voice from a sloop a
few rods away, as the captain of the <i>Surprise</i> came
on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, Jeff!&rdquo; answered Harvey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The speaker was Jeff Hackett, who ran a small
sloop from the foot of Grand Island over to the mainland
once a day to carry the mails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in this race, too?&rdquo; queried Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather think I am,&rdquo; responded Harvey. &ldquo;Think
I&rsquo;ve got any chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as though you had,&rdquo; answered the
other. &ldquo;There are only eight yachts going to start.
The others backed out because they didn&rsquo;t think the
handicapping was fair. It&rsquo;s all right, though. You
will have to give us fellows a trifle allowance, by
just a rough measurement on the water-line; but
you&rsquo;ll get the same from the <i>Bertha</i> and the <i>Anna
Maud</i>. They are the only boats that are bigger than
yours. You want to get measured right away, too,
or it will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey had soon complied with the requirements
of the regatta committee, as the committee of summer
guests chosen to act as judges were pleased to
style themselves, and shortly before the hour for the
race the yacht <i>Surprise</i> sailed out of the harbour at
Bellport, and stood off and on before the starting-line
with the others.</p>
<p>Harvey was in high feather, for, by his own estimate
of the situation, he had a fair chance of winning.
He knew most of the boats, either by reputation, or
from having seen them sail, and the others he was
able to judge of in a great measure by their general
appearance.</p>
<p>The prize to be sailed for was a handsome silver
cup, for which a subscription had been taken up among
the summer residents of Bellport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>The <i>Bertha</i>, which conceded the greatest time allowance
to Harvey&rsquo;s boat, was a handsome sloop,
about four feet longer than the <i>Surprise</i>, and carrying
heavy sail. She had never been considered a fast
boat of her size, but, owing to the discrepancy in
lengths, had to allow the <i>Surprise</i> several minutes
over the complete course of ten miles. This, as the
<i>Surprise</i> was really fast for her size and rig, would
make it quite an even race.</p>
<p>The <i>Bertha</i> was under charter by a party of young
men from Benton, who had engaged a sailing-master
to pilot her for them during the summer. This made
them an object of contempt in Harvey&rsquo;s eyes, and he
wished all the more to &ldquo;take the conceit out of them,&rdquo;
as he expressed it.</p>
<p>The <i>Anna Maud</i> was a big catboat, thirty-three
feet long, carrying an enormous mainsail, and reputed
to be one of the fastest boats of her size in the bay.
She was owned and sailed by Captain Silas Tucker,
a native of one of the islands at the foot of the
western bay, that formed part of the main thoroughfare
leading out to sea. He was generally accorded
the distinction of being the best skipper on this part
of the coast.</p>
<p>All the other boats, except one, were smaller than
the <i>Surprise</i>. That one was the Sally, a sloop of
exactly the same length as the <i>Surprise</i>, and apparently
able to sail about on equal terms with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>The starting-signal was to be a gunshot, the gun
to be fired five minutes after a first warning shot. In
the interval after the first shot the yachts could
man&oelig;uvre about the starting-line, ready to cross when
the second shot was fired. As soon as the second
shot was fired, it was allowable for a yacht to cross
the line, and all yachts were to be timed one minute
after the second gun, whether they had actually
crossed the line or not. So that it was to the advantage
of all nine craft to be as near the starting-line
as possible at the signal, and under headway and
also up to windward as far as possible.</p>
<p>Harvey&rsquo;s boldness stood him in good stead here.
And, moreover, he certainly did know the working
of his yacht to a nicety. After the warning gun had
been fired, he made his calculations carefully, allowing
for the tide which was running out to sea. The
race was to be five miles straight out to windward,
and a run home, off the wind. The ebb-tide, and the
southerly breeze rolling a sea in to meet it, made an
ugly chop, and the boats thrashed around, throwing
the spray clear aboard.</p>
<p>Just before the second gun the relative positions of
the four largest yachts were as follows: farthest up
to windward was the <i>Surprise</i>; abeam of her, and a
short distance to leeward, was the <i>Bertha</i>; then the
<i>Anna Maud</i>, and then the <i>Sally</i>. The <i>Sally</i>, like the
Surprise, had an amateur skipper, a youth of about
Harvey&rsquo;s age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>The <i>Sally</i> was a new boat, not long out of the
shipyard, in fact. She was perhaps the prettiest craft
there. Her hull was beautifully modelled, with a
graceful overhang, bow and stern; her sails snow-white,
and mast and spars were glistening. She
steered with a wheel of ornamental mahogany and
brass, and here and there about her cabin and furnishings
brass and mahogany had been used, regardless
of expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie Grimes has us all beat for beauty,&rdquo; remarked
Harvey, as they neared the line, &ldquo;but that
boat is too new for racing; that is, he&rsquo;s too scared
for fear something will happen to her. Most everybody
is that way. I used to be scared of the <i>Surprise</i>
all the time for fear something would knock a bit
of paint off somewhere. It takes about a year to
get over that. He handles her as though he was
afraid something was going to break. Just watch me
take advantage of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey had seen that the <i>Anna Maud</i> and the
<i>Bertha</i> would cross the line a moment ahead of him,
but he did not mind that so much, thinking his time
allowance would give him more than a good chance
for the race, anyway. He had selected the <i>Sally</i> for
his particular antagonist, and now prepared to get
what advantage he could from the start.</p>
<p>Easing his sheet a trifle, he headed off the wind
somewhat, allowing the two larger yachts to sail
almost directly across his bows. Rushing out just
astern of them, and heading diagonally for the starting-line,
under full headway, Harvey bore down on
the <i>Sally</i>, as though he meant deliberately to run her
down.</p>
<p>If young Willie Grimes had not been so taken by
surprise and so alarmed at this move of Harvey&rsquo;s,
he would have perceived that the man&oelig;uvre was only
done to try his nerve; he would have realized that
as good a sailor as Harvey would not deliberately
foul another yacht, when that must lose him the race,
as well as the boat he fouled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>But Harvey had reckoned on the other&rsquo;s apprehension
for his new boat, and the move was successful.
Just at the point where a moment more would have
sent his boom crashing aboard the other yacht as he
headed up into the wind, Harvey threw his yacht
quickly about, Joe Hinman hauled in rapidly on the
main-sheet, Tim Reardon trimmed in the jibs, and
away went the <i>Surprise</i> over the line, footing after
the two other boats as fast as full sail would carry
her.</p>
<p>At that same moment Willie Grimes, fearful of a
collision, threw the <i>Sally</i> completely off the wind, so
that when he had recovered his nerve and realized
that he had been imposed upon, he was so far below
the boat that marked the limit of the starting-line
that he had to make another tack to reach it. Before
this, the last gun had been fired to mark the taking
of the time, and the luckless <i>Sally</i> crossed the line
with one full minute counting against her.</p>
<p>The youth&rsquo;s face burned with indignation, and he
had hard work to keep the tears from springing to
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye-bye, Willie,&rdquo; sang out Harvey, looking back
and waving his cap derisively. &ldquo;Better courage next
time. You don&rsquo;t want to mind a little paint, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>But the other had regained his spirits and paid no
heed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what yachtsmen call &lsquo;jockeying,&rsquo; I
guess,&rdquo; he said, quietly, to his two companions in the
boat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s within the rules, so I suppose we cannot
complain. That&rsquo;s like Harvey, from all I hear. He
might have given us a fair show, though, as he knows
this is my first summer running a boat by myself.
Perhaps we won&rsquo;t be far astern of him at the finish,
at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did that slick, Jack,&rdquo; said Joe Hinman, admiringly.
&ldquo;We stand a good chance of winning this
race, I think, with the allowance we get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he scoot, though, when he saw us coming?&rdquo;
laughed Harvey. &ldquo;Thought his new boat was
wrecked that time, sure. I&rsquo;ve seen that trick played
in big yacht races, but I never saw it work better
than it did to-day, if I do say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yachts were now strung out in line along the
course, tacking back and forth, and making for a
small naphtha launch anchored down the bay at the
five-mile mark. They made a picturesque sight, laying
well over under all their canvas and throwing the
water high over their bows.</p>
<p>It was soon evident that the <i>Bertha</i>, take it all in
all, was the best boat for working up to windward in
rough water and a good breeze. The <i>Anna Maud</i>
was a very broad, beamy boat, and had a marvellous
reputation for running free, but now she seemed to
feel the waves more than the <i>Bertha</i>, pounding heavily
and drenching every one aboard.</p>
<p>The <i>Bertha</i> took the seas cleaner and headed up
higher. She was evidently gaining slowly but steadily.
Moreover, although she carried an enormous
club-topsail and a mainsail of big area, she heeled over
the least of any of the boats. She had been built for
heavy weather, and this was exactly the breeze she
sailed best in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>The <i>Surprise</i> and <i>Sally</i> were, however, holding their
own remarkably well, and it would not be clear for
some time which would come out the winner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack Harvey, suddenly, in a
tone of evident surprise. &ldquo;What on earth&mdash;or,
rather, on water&mdash;is Cap&rsquo;n Silas doing? Look where
he is standing. I&rsquo;ve been looking for the last few
minutes to see him tack, but there he keeps on away
off toward shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Anna Maud</i> had, strange to say, gone way off
the course, apparently heading well over to the westward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; said Joe Hinman,
&ldquo;how we&rsquo;ve noticed the tide over along that shore?
It makes a swing in there and runs like a mill-sluice.
Don&rsquo;t you remember one night how we tried to row
against it, and what a time we had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; responded Jack Harvey, &ldquo;and Cap&rsquo;n
Sile Tucker is clever enough to take advantage of it.
He knows more about sailing in one minute than that
captain of the <i>Bertha</i> does in a week. But there must
be something more in it than the tide alone. I&rsquo;ll tell
you, the wind is changing. It&rsquo;s heading more and
more from the westward, and Captain Sile will get
the full benefit of the slant when he gets down about
a mile further. He knows what he&rsquo;s doing. We&rsquo;ll
just head over and follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s taking long chances to go so
much off the course,&rdquo; remarked George Baker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is taking chances,&rdquo; responded Harvey,
quickly. &ldquo;You have got to take chances in a
contest of this kind. The fellows that take the chances
are the ones that win. But it isn&rsquo;t taking any great
chances, following Cap&rsquo;n Tucker. I tell you he knows
these waters better than any man in the bay. He
wouldn&rsquo;t go over there unless he knew he was going
to make something by it. Why, he has sailed that
big catboat of his up and down along this coast for the
last twenty years and more, that and other boats. The
skipper in the <i>Bertha</i> comes from away up beyond
Millville. He can sail his boat all right, but he don&rsquo;t
know this coast like Captain Sile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey, accordingly, stood over to the westward,
in the wake of the <i>Anna Maud</i>.</p>
<p>Only one other boat followed him. That was the
<i>Sally</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they are standing away over
there for,&rdquo; said Willie Grimes to his companions. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether it is the best thing to do or not.
It may be that they know something about the tide
over there. But I know one thing, and that is, wherever
Jack Harvey goes I&rsquo;m going to follow. I
wouldn&rsquo;t care if every other yacht here beat me if
I could only beat him. You never can tell, you know.
Something may happen to him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wisdom of Captain Silas Tucker&rsquo;s departure
from the straight course soon became apparent. The
tide, indeed, at this point made a sweep inshore, for
some reason, flowing far swifter in near the land than
it did offshore. Again, too, the wind had slanted a
little, and the yachts that had taken this course were
soon in a better position relative to the stake-boat
than the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Slowly the <i>Anna Maud</i> drew ahead of the <i>Bertha</i>,
the captain of the latter boat realizing the advantage
which the others were gaining too late to change
his own course. As they neared the mark, even the
<i>Surprise</i> and the <i>Sally</i> were leading the <i>Bertha</i>, which
now seemed to be hopelessly out of the race.</p>
<p>The race, indeed, seemed narrowed down to these
three yachts, with a slight advantage in the <i>Anna
Maud&rsquo;s</i> favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Harvey, &ldquo;we are holding the
<i>Anna Maud</i> in fine style. She&rsquo;s gaining ever so little,
not enough thus far to cover our time allowance.
They say she is fast off the wind, but so are we.
That&rsquo;s the best point of the <i>Surprise</i>. She sails better
running free than any boat of her size I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracky!&rdquo; cried young Tim, &ldquo;I hope we take
that silver cup back to camp with us. We&rsquo;ll march
through the streets with it, if we get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we get it,&rdquo; replied Harvey. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t do
to be too sure, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the <i>Anna Maud</i> was rounding the stake-boat
and coming back over the course, not quite before the
wind, owing to the slant to the westward that it had
taken, but with her sheet well out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind is in our favour,&rdquo; said Harvey, gleefully.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just enough slant to it so our jibs
will help us some. They will draw a little, and that
gives us an advantage over that catboat. Let that
sheet go, now, Joe, the minute we turn the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>A moment later the <i>Surprise</i> rounded the stake-boat,
with a good lead over the <i>Sally</i>, and still near
enough astern of the <i>Anna Maud</i> to give her a good
race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with that centreboard, now, George&mdash;lively,&rdquo;
cried Harvey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big board, and we
don&rsquo;t want to drag it a minute longer than we have
to. It counts a whole lot with this tide running
against it. What&rsquo;s the matter? What are you waiting
for? Up with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hang the thing!&rdquo; exclaimed George Baker,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get it up as hard as ever I can. It
won&rsquo;t come. It&rsquo;s stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Harvey. &ldquo;Stuck? Nonsense!
Here, you, Joe, hold this wheel a moment. I&rsquo;ll
have it up in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang forward, brushing George Baker out
of the way impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get hold there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Harvey seized the iron rod, which was fastened
to the centreboard, and gave a strong pull. But the
centreboard did not budge. He took a firmer hold
and pulled with all his strength. It was of no avail.
The board had stuck fast in its box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it up or break something,&rdquo; cried Harvey,
beside himself with anger, and again he grasped
the rod with both hands and gave a furious wrench.
There was a most unexpected and baffling verification
of his threat, for the rod, broken off short at its
connection with the centreboard, did come up, so
suddenly that Harvey sprawled over backwards, still
grasping the rod with both hands clenched, and rolled
over on the floor of the cockpit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>There was no such thing as getting the centreboard
up now. It was down to stay.</p>
<p>Harvey, white with rage, sprang to his feet and
hurled the rod into the sea. Then he took his seat
sullenly at the wheel again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he could speak
for anger. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a ghost of a chance now.
I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, even, if the <i>Sally</i> overhauled us.&rdquo;
And he looked back helplessly at the yacht astern.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely the <i>Anna Maud</i> forged ahead.
The distance between her and the <i>Surprise</i> grew ever
farther and farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; said Captain Silas Tucker, looking
back at Harvey&rsquo;s yacht. &ldquo;I thought she was going
to give us a harder run home than that. I&rsquo;ve heard
the boat was good off the wind, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem
to be doing well. It&rsquo;s first prize for us this trip, and
easily won. Well, your Uncle Silas hasn&rsquo;t sailed
around these parts all his life for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, too, the <i>Sally</i> was creeping up
close astern of the <i>Surprise</i>, to the wild delight of
Willie Grimes and his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can only beat Jack Harvey,&rdquo; he kept saying,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the other yacht&rsquo;s beating us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Willie Grimes beats us, I&rsquo;ll run him down and
sink him some day,&rdquo; muttered Harvey, grinding his
teeth.</p>
<p>It was still a close race between these two as the
finish-line was neared. The <i>Sally</i> had crept up until
she was almost abeam of the <i>Surprise</i>, and was gaining,
ever so slowly, but surely. Harvey, dogged to
the last, waited until the <i>Sally</i> was nearly abreast of
him, and then, as a last resort, tried once more to
bully the race from his less experienced rival.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Throwing his wheel over slightly, he tried the
tactic of crowding the other off the course.</p>
<p>But Willie Grimes was bound to win or sink this
time. He kept his own boat off just enough to avoid
the possibility of Harvey&rsquo;s fouling him, maintaining
the same relative distance between them, and all the
while drawing ahead.</p>
<p>The judges, watching the close finish through their
glasses, perceived this trick of Harvey&rsquo;s, and were
ready to disqualify him in case of any accident. But
their determination was unnecessary. Less than a
dozen rods from the finish-line the <i>Sally</i> had sailed
clear of the <i>Surprise</i>, and now cut in on to the course,
leaving Harvey astern, and crossed the line a rod to
the good.</p>
<p>Then, as a storm of cheers rang out from the
assembled boats, as a fluttering of handkerchiefs and
waving of parasols, a tossing of hats and shrieking
of whistles, saluted the victory of Willie Grimes over
him, Harvey did not deign to cross the line. Angrily
he swung out of the course, and stood over, without
a word, for the town of Bellport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Takes his licking hard, doesn&rsquo;t he, Willie?&rdquo; called
out a voice, and a chorus of laughter mocked at Harvey&rsquo;s
wrath as he sailed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>The <i>Anna Maud</i> had won the race, but the honours
were as much for the <i>Sally</i> as for the winner. They
took substantial form, moreover, for, one of the committee,
vowing the <i>Sally</i> should have a second prize,
if he had to buy one himself, as there had not
been any offered, the suggestion met with a ready
response; and the owner and crew of the <i>Sally</i> rejoiced
that night in the unexpected award of a handsome
compass for their cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Harvey, as the <i>Surprise</i> neared the
landing at Bellport, &ldquo;I want to get out of this town
just as quick as I step foot in it. I don&rsquo;t intend to
stay here and have those chaps and those girls laugh
at me. They&rsquo;ve got altogether too good a chance.
You fellows have got to stay here and take the <i>Surprise</i>
up to Billy Coombs&rsquo;s marine railway. She&rsquo;ll
have to be hauled out for a day and the ballast come
out of her around that centreboard box. Tell him to put
a new iron in, and you can pay for it, Joe, and I&rsquo;ll
pay you when you come back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are you going?&rdquo; asked the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to foot it down the road for seven
miles to Hackett&rsquo;s Cove, and wait for Jeff Hackett
to come down,&rdquo; answered Harvey. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go
across to the foot of the island with him in his sloop.
I&rsquo;d walk farther than that to get clear of the crowd
that will be ashore here soon; but, for that matter,
I want to get back to the island to-night, anyway.
There&rsquo;s a dance in the old town hall at Carter&rsquo;s Harbour,
and I&rsquo;ll get there in time for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all cut up over Willie Grimes&rsquo;s beating him,&rdquo;
said Joe Hinman, as Harvey sprang out on the landing
and walked rapidly away. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get over
it for a week. Well, we shall have to catch it for
him when the boats come in. However, we didn&rsquo;t
sail the boat. That&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Late that afternoon, Jack Harvey, hot and dusty
with his long walk, waited impatiently, seated on a
pile of timber by the shore, for the arrival of Jeff
Hackett&rsquo;s sloop. Five o&rsquo;clock came, and then six,
and no sloop in sight. Harvey strolled up to the
village store and bought some crackers and cheese
for his supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re waiting for Jeff Hackett&rsquo;s sloop to take
you across to the island, are you?&rdquo; said the storekeeper.
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll wait till morning now, I
reckon. Wish I&rsquo;d known you wanted to go over
sooner. You see, Jeff engaged Tom Crosby to make
his trip this afternoon for him, and he&rsquo;s been gone
an hour now. You must have seen Tom&rsquo;s boat off
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Harvey, shortly, &ldquo;but I had no
idea he was going across. What can I do, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I see,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, &ldquo;except
to take it comfortable here to-night, and go over
with Jeff in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey strode angrily out and walked down to the
shore again.</p>
<p>A rod or two out a fisherman was rowing in a
small boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you, where are you going?&rdquo; sang out
Harvey.</p>
<p>The man looked up, surprised, but did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, there, where are you going? Can&rsquo;t you
hear?&rdquo; cried Harvey, roughly.</p>
<p>The man stopped rowing. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;
he answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>Harvey laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me there,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve been disappointed.
I didn&rsquo;t know but you might be going to
row across to the island, and I thought perhaps you
might like to earn a dollar. I&rsquo;ll help row, too, if you
like. I want to go, the worst way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated for a moment, started as though
he were going to row away, and then paused again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you belong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over on the island,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m camping
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the man, putting his hand
to his ear. &ldquo;Say it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m camping out over on the island,&rdquo; repeated
Harvey.</p>
<p>The man looked stealthily in at him from under
his eyebrows. &ldquo;Camping there!&rdquo; he muttered to
himself, and began backing water slowly with his
oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you across for&mdash;for a dollar,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Harvey. &ldquo;Come on, lively, then.
It&rsquo;s a good five miles, and I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get
across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, however, was in no hurry. He came
in slowly, as though perhaps he might still be considering
the matter, whether he should take this
passenger aboard or not. He worked the boat inshore,
finally, and Harvey sprang aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to help row,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Harvey. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say I
would?&rdquo; He took his seat toward the stern of the
boat, where there were rowlocks for an extra pair of
oars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>The man at the bow oars was a thick, heavy-set,
middle-aged man, burned dark by sun and wind. He
was roughly dressed in ill-fitting clothes, that looked
as though they might have come from the dunnage-bag
of a fisherman who had been long at sea. They
were patched in one or two places with cloth that did
not match the original garments. He wore a red,
cheap-looking handkerchief tied loosely about his
neck, and a rough beard of several weeks&rsquo; growth
heightened the effect of his swarthy complexion.</p>
<p>They rowed for some time in silence, making good
headway, for the wind had gone down with the sun,
and the man in the bow pulled a powerful stroke,
making even the sturdy efforts of Jack Harvey seem
like child&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>The sun sank behind the hills and the shadows
deepened across the water, fading out at length into
the darkness that settled over all the bay. A few
lights glimmered out from the shore of the island,
some three miles distant, and the stars appeared in
the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky I fell in with you, just as I did,&rdquo; said
Harvey, as he slowed up his stroke. &ldquo;Lucky for both
of us, I take it. I should have been stuck there all
night if I hadn&rsquo;t met you; and I don&rsquo;t suppose you
mind picking up a dollar, as long as you were going
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, though there was a queer
expression on his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&mdash;and the
fishing isn&rsquo;t any too good these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a smack, have you?&rdquo; inquired Harvey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own any
boat myself. But I sail with a man as owns his own
boat, and I come in for a fair share of the fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does she lie?&rdquo; asked Harvey.</p>
<p>The man waited a moment before answering.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s down among the islands somewhere,&rdquo; he said,
finally. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be in for me to-night or to-morrow.
I&rsquo;ve been visiting some relations of mine back of
Bellport a few miles. So you&rsquo;re a summer visitor
at the island, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harvey, &ldquo;I spend my summers
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty quiet place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly,&rdquo; returned Harvey, &ldquo;but not so quiet this
year. We&rsquo;ve had some exciting times there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had slowed up, himself, in his rowing now. And
if by chance the conversation had turned whither he
had intended it should, there was no way that Harvey
should know of that, for his back was toward the
man and he could not see his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued Harvey, &ldquo;they caught the men
that stole the Curtis diamonds over there; that is,
they got two of them. A third one escaped. He was
the worst of the three, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the bow had paused in his rowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst one got away, did he?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;It seemed one of them
had the diamonds hidden in a house that every one
thought was haunted. He was stopping at the hotel
as a regular guest. And no one suspected him but
Henry Burns. Then, when his confederates came, the
detectives were lying in wait for them in the cellar.
They nearly beat the detectives, though, at that. For
they smashed the lanterns out&mdash;that is, one of them
did, and made a run for it. The other one was hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he die?&rdquo; asked the man, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Harvey. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, waiting
trial along with the other one. We got him, too, just
as he was nearly down to shore, where the other man
was waiting to take him off in a boat. The third
man escaped in his yacht. We only captured two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the bow had drawn his oars in, now,
so that they rested along the side of the boat. His
hands worked nervously together, and he half-rose
in his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked, huskily. &ldquo;Who did it&mdash;did
you have a hand in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, by chance, this moment was a crisis in the life
of Jack Harvey, and if, by chance, he was in greater
danger at this moment than he had ever been before
in all his life, there was no shadow of it across his
mind. He answered with a laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not I. No such luck. If there&rsquo;s anything
like that going on, I&rsquo;m sure to miss it. No, &rsquo;twas
the other camp and a crowd I have no liking for that
did it all, that got all the glory and all the fun and
the money, too. The reward, I mean. I&rsquo;d rather
have been there at the capture, though, than get the
money for it. And I don&rsquo;t know why, but I felt
rather sorry for the two chaps that got caught, bad
as they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good speech for you, Jack Harvey, if you did
but know it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you missed all the fun, did you?&rdquo; said the
man, quietly. &ldquo;That was too bad; too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had put his oars into the water once more now,
and resumed his rowing. He did not pause to rest
again, but pulled long and steadily. Evidently he
did not care to row and talk too, for he lapsed into
silence now, and Harvey could not draw him into
conversation again. At the end of another hour they
had come close to the Grand Island shore, and shortly
they had pulled alongside a ledge, where Harvey could
jump out. The man started to row away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, hold on, there,&rdquo; cried Harvey. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
want your dollar? You&rsquo;ve earned it, fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man came slowly back to shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, as he stretched out his hand, &ldquo;I
ought not to forget that, with the fishing as bad as
it is.&rdquo; And then he added, quietly, as he started to
row away again, &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s worth a dollar to you
to get here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; replied Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; said the man to himself.</p>
<p>Then he rowed down the shore for about a mile
farther, turned into a sheltered cove, rowed his boat
alongside a black sloop that lay moored there, climbed
aboard, dragged the boat aboard, and waited for an
hour or so, till a faint breeze stole across the water.
Then he hoisted sail on the sloop and drifted slowly
out of the cove; drifted slowly away from the island,
and was swallowed up in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">GOOD FOR EVIL</span></h2>
<p>The yacht <i>Spray</i>, arriving home again in the
harbour of Southport, two days following the
discovery made by Henry Burns, had created
somewhat of a sensation: first, because, on account
of the storm, there had been felt considerable alarm
for the little boat, and, second, because of the story
that the boys had to tell.</p>
<p>The finding of the letter &ldquo;E&rdquo; confirmed their story,
so that there could be no room for doubt that the
yacht <i>Eagle</i> had been secreted there in the Thoroughfare
and refitted. The question now was, had the
man who had done this left the bay and gone on his
voyage, or had he chosen, for some purpose or other,
to linger in some part of the great bay till a later
time.</p>
<p>Henry Burns now told the story of the man they
had seen at the foot of Grand Island, how he had
sailed in and out of the harbour so mysteriously, how
he seemed to avoid them, and how there had apparently
been none other than he aboard the black
yacht.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>Most of the people of the village were inclined to
the belief that the man Chambers had gone out to
sea as soon as he had altered his yacht so that it would
escape detection in such harbours as he would be
obliged to make. There was no possible reason why
he should return, they said, and every reason in the
world why he should get away from that part of the
coast as soon as he could.</p>
<p>There were plenty of black yachts, they argued,
that would answer the general description of the yacht
seen by the boys at the foot of the island; and, as for
sailing out and away in the night, that was a thing
commonly done among fishermen, to take advantage
of wind and tide when it was important that they
should reach a certain port on time.</p>
<p>Still, there were one or two yachts that set out
cruising about the bay, on the chance of running into
the mysterious craft, and they cruised about for a
week or more. Every strange sail that looked as
though it might belong to a yacht of the size of the
<i>Eagle</i> was pursued, until it had either outsailed the
pursuers and disappeared, or until a nearer view had
proven that it was not the hunted craft.</p>
<p>By the end of two weeks the village was well satisfied
that Chambers and the yacht <i>Eagle</i> were far
away, and had ceased to think of him, except as a
group gathered of an evening about the village grocery-store
and talked of that for lack of something
better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>In the meantime, when the excitement was at its
height, the Warren boys in their yacht, and Tom and
Bob in their canoe, took a hand in the search. Even
Henry Burns took an occasional spin on his bicycle
down to the foot of the island of an evening, and
wandered along the shore in the hope of catching a
glimpse once more of the sail he had seen that night
in the harbour. Just what he expected to do in case
he should see it, he did not know, himself; still, it
might be that he could spread the alarm and start
some of the boats out after any suspicious craft that
he saw.</p>
<p>For the time being it was in all the air. Nobody
talked of anything else. It was really more because
people dearly love a mystery than that they actually
believed the <i>Eagle</i> was still in the bay; but the talk
sufficed to keep the boys at fever-heat, and Henry
Burns firmly believed that he had seen the <i>Eagle</i> that
night.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob were indefatigable for ten days in
searching on their own account. They would take
their canoe in the afternoon, paddle down five or
six miles along the shore of the island, land in some
lonely spot, haul the canoe on shore, and then continue
along on foot for a mile or two, coming up
cautiously to some cove with which they had become
familiar in their trips through the summer, only to
find it empty of sails, or some fishing-boat lying snug
for the night, and which could by no means be mistaken
for the craft of which they were in search.</p>
<p>Again, they would paddle down to the Narrows,
carry the canoe over into the western bay, leave it hidden
until sundown, and then go down along the shore
on that side of the island, repeating their walk along
the shore. Some days they left the canoe hidden for
the night away down the island, and came back to the
village afoot along the road, going after it afoot the
next night, and retracing their search of the night
before, thus varying the search in a dozen different
ways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>But the result was always the same. It seemed
this time as though the <i>Eagle</i>, if it had, indeed, ever
lingered in the bay, had gone for good. What might
have been the result if those who sailed in search
of the mysterious craft had known that the description
they now had of her was at fault, can never be
known. Be that as it might, the exact yacht that
Henry Burns and his friends had seen down at the
foot of the island no longer existed. In its place there
sailed&mdash;somewhere, on some waters&mdash;a handsome,
black yacht, with a tall, slender, glistening topmast,
white sails, and gleaming brass, in place of the dingy,
dirty fisherman. She was as fine and handsome, and
as polished as to deck and fittings, as the <i>Eagle</i> had
been of yore, only her colour remained as it had been
changed&mdash;black.</p>
<p>Was this boat the <i>Eagle</i>? Those who sailed the
bay in quest of her had no means of knowing, for
if they ever did get sight of her it was but a far,
fleeting, shadowy glance. They never came within
miles of her, this fleet, beautiful, and disappearing
yacht. Across her stern in letters of gold was the
name <i>Sprite</i>. It may have been most appropriate,
for now and then a distant view of her tempted some
bay craft to follow; but it was like a dog pursuing
a bird on the wing. She always drifted on and on,
out of reach, and disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>Since the night when the man that rowed Jack
Harvey across the bay had climbed aboard this yacht
and sailed southward, the yacht had never ventured
near Grand Island, nor within miles and miles of it.
If the man Chambers had any plan which he meant
to execute, it did not suit his purpose to attempt it at
this time. He had, perhaps, achieved all he desired
now, in familiarizing himself with the waters of this
coast.</p>
<p>Of all those who joined in the search for the strange
yacht, there was none more enthusiastic nor persistent
than Jack Harvey. No sooner had his own yacht
been brought back from Bellport by the crew, than he
stocked up with a week&rsquo;s provisions and began cruising
day and night. To be sure, it was a most uncertain
chase, but Harvey was willing to take chances
that others would not; and if he should by mistake intercept
some respectable craft for a few brief moments,
he would rely on his assurance to carry him through
and explain matters.</p>
<p>Harvey had, moreover, a critical eye for a good
boat, and had noted the <i>Eagle</i>, when it had been in
the harbour, with more than passing interest, and was
certain now that he should know her again, even with
a change of rig. Besides, he had the description furnished
by Henry Burns and the other boys of the
yacht they had seen, which corresponded in size with
the <i>Eagle</i>.</p>
<p>He had never been so aroused about anything before
in all his life. The adventure that Henry Burns and
the others had had with the two men that had been
caught was an experience after his own heart. He
would have given his whole summer&rsquo;s fun to take
part in that capture. But all the glory of that had
been denied him; now he made a resolve that if any
one succeeded in finding the vanished yacht it should
be he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>His activity was not destined to go all for naught,
either, for on at least one occasion he was satisfied in
his own mind that he had met with the yacht,&mdash;yes,
and nearly come to close quarters with the man that
sailed it.</p>
<p>It was miles below Grand Island, for Harvey had
for some days made up his mind that the man he
sought had left the bay, since he had scoured it east
and west and north and south in vain. It was down
among some islands that lay out of the much travelled
part of the bay, and not far from the Gull Island
Thoroughfare. It was, in fact, just at the outer rim
of the bay, where several channels through a chain
of islands led out to sea. There were three of the
crew aboard besides Harvey, only little Tim being
left ashore to guard the camp.</p>
<p>They had been cruising all evening among these
islands, for it was a part of the coast with which
Harvey was very familiar. They were carrying no
lights, for the chances of being run down here were
small, and, besides, it was a part of Harvey&rsquo;s plan to
be able to approach any chance craft unobserved.</p>
<p>It had come on rainy, and the crew were for putting
in at some harbour and lying snug, but Harvey
would not hear of it. He had sailed until near midnight
for about a week, and did not like to give it up.</p>
<p>However, as a concession to his crew, and as it
bade fair to blow up a nasty sea before many hours,
Harvey had consented to beat back and forth under
the lee of a small unnamed island, keeping a lookout
down the bay for the little distance they could see
through the rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>It seemed that some other craft was also willing to
take the risk of sailing without lights, for, along about
ten o&rsquo;clock, a yacht, that might or might not be the
one for which they sought, was beating up toward
the island, with all dark on board. All at once the
man that sat at the wheel left his boat for a moment
to itself, so that it headed up into the wind with sails
flapping, while he darted down into the cabin.</p>
<p>He was gone only for a moment, but in that brief
moment that he was below a light flashed in the cabin,&mdash;only
a fleeting gleam of light, and then all was dark
again.</p>
<p>This gleam of light, transient as it was, had sufficed,
however, for the sharp lookout aboard the <i>Surprise</i>.</p>
<p>Harvey seized Joe Hinman by the shoulder and
whispered, as he steered the <i>Surprise</i> out from behind
the end of the island: &ldquo;Did you see that, Joe? Did
you see it? There&rsquo;s something coming up. Everybody
keep quiet now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an excited group that crouched silently
in the cockpit of the <i>Surprise</i> as she swung out from
under the lee of the island and headed straight for
the spot where they had seen the flash of light, running
almost before the wind.</p>
<p>Whatever the craft was, it seemed as if they must
surely catch it, leaping out as they had from the darkness.
All at once they saw the dark outline of a
yacht almost dead ahead, and saw for a moment the
shadow of its sails, a faint blur through the rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>Then the yacht veered about suddenly, and they saw
the white crush of water as it heeled over, and, running
with the wind on its quarter, was gone, like a
boat that had vanished. So sudden and so silent was
the man&oelig;uvre that they could hardly realize that the
yacht had, indeed, turned like a flash and run away.
They followed for a moment, but, seeing how useless
it was, Harvey soon gave up the chase and went back
to harbour, beaten but not discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the man we want,&rdquo; he said, as they
came to in the nearest harbour that night. &ldquo;No other
craft would have gone off its course that way. And
to think we were almost upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t see what good it would have done
us to have come up with him, if it was the man,&rdquo;
replied Allan Harding. &ldquo;We could only have taken
a look aboard. What else could we have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; answered Harvey, emphatically.
&ldquo;It would have done a lot of good. I tell you that
wherever and whenever I meet that yacht, whether it&rsquo;s
night or day, I&rsquo;m going to run alongside, and you
fellows and I are going aboard. I&rsquo;ve been doing things
to be ashamed of long enough,&mdash;not that I&rsquo;m ashamed
of them, either, as I know of. Only they have been
things that I didn&rsquo;t dare tell of afterward, and I&rsquo;m
sort of tired of it. I tell you, I want to do something
for once that I can boast of and that people won&rsquo;t
hate me for. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so anxious about this,
if you must know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; cried Joe Hinman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something
new for you, Jack. I didn&rsquo;t suppose your conscience
ever troubled you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Harvey, angrily.</p>
<p>But perhaps it did.</p>
<p>By the end of a few days more, Harvey had given
up the search, convinced that they had seen the last
of the black yacht, if, indeed, they had seen it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beaten, and that&rsquo;s all
there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the idea of ever seeing the strange yacht
again was given up by all. The yachts came back to
harbour, and the impression became general that they
had all been fooled; that what they had sought was a
delusion.</p>
<p>Tom and Bob were the last to give up. Partly because
they liked these long paddles together and the
long walks along the island roads, and partly because
they had helped start the renewed hunt for the yacht
<i>Eagle</i>, and did not like to admit that they had made
a mistake.</p>
<p>So they did not wholly discontinue their evening
paddles nor their lonely rambles along the shore. It
was good exercise, at all events, they argued.</p>
<p>One evening they started right after supper, while
it was yet light, paddled down along the shore to the
Narrows, carried across, and paddled down the island
for some three miles. Then they landed and hid their
canoe, as was their custom, and stretched themselves
out on the beach to rest and enjoy the lights far out
on the water.</p>
<p>It was a clear starlight night, with the bay still
and restful, save for a quick gust of wind that came
now and then, only to blur its surface for a moment
and leave it smooth again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we have tried this thing about often
enough, haven&rsquo;t we, Bob?&rdquo; asked Tom, finally. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t seem to be a success as man-hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about ready to quit,&rdquo; answered Bob, yawning
and stretching. &ldquo;The fact is, we really get enough
exercise through the day. Here we&rsquo;ve been swimming,
bicycling, helping the Warrens get up driftwood, paddled
over to the cape, all in one day,&mdash;and here we
are at it again at night. Yes, I think it&rsquo;s time we
gave this up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then supposing we do call it off,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had paddling enough for one day. What do
you say to going up along the beach for a mile or
two, and then taking the shortest cut home and coming
down for the canoe to-morrow? I think I&rsquo;m kind
of tired, myself, though I didn&rsquo;t notice it when we
started out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, that suits me,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind saying that I&rsquo;m a bit tired, too. That last mile
came hard, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they rose and sauntered along the beach toward
the Narrows, till they had come to within about half
a mile of it, and then sat down once more for a brief
rest before going home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems almost too bad to go home to bed such a
beautiful night as this,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;These are the
kind of nights that make me wish we had the old
tent back again, so we could lie on our bunks and
look out on the water, as we used to do before we went
to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>The night was indeed singularly calm and peaceful.
The bay was still, and the water as it came up the
beach with the tide made only a small rustling, creeping
sound, as it covered the sand inch by inch. As
for the island, it always seemed asleep after nightfall,
and to-night there was scarcely a sound of life anywhere
to break the stillness.</p>
<p>But then, all at once, as they sat there looking out
upon the water, out of the silence there arose a cry,
faint and smothered, but a cry for help.</p>
<p>Then all was still again.</p>
<p>They sprang to their feet, startled, almost frightened
for a brief moment at the strange cry, coming from
they knew not where.</p>
<p>Again the cry came, this time more distinctly, from
somewhere out on the water. They heard the words,
&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; uttered in a choking voice, as of a
man drowning.</p>
<p>The boys rushed down to the water&rsquo;s edge and peered
out over the bay, straining their eyes to see whence
the sound came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa! Hulloa! Where are you? What&rsquo;s the
matter? Call again!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>They listened, and in a moment the voice came again
weirdly over the water, though they could not distinguish
this time the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there it is,&rdquo; cried Bob, all at once, pointing
as he spoke. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it, Tom? I declare,
but it&rsquo;s queer we didn&rsquo;t see it before. Look, there&rsquo;s
something floating only about an eighth of a mile out,&mdash;and
there&rsquo;s something moving a little distance from
it. Why, Tom, I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is. It&rsquo;s a canoe&mdash;it&rsquo;s
Jack Harvey&mdash;and he&rsquo;s upset&mdash;he&rsquo;s drowning.
Just look, where I am pointing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, excitedly. &ldquo;I just
saw a splash. He&rsquo;s upset, sure enough, and struggling.
I say, Bob, we&rsquo;ve got to swim out. Our canoe
is too far. Keep up! We&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; he called,
and began hurriedly to strip off his clothing.</p>
<p>In a moment the two boys were in the water, striking
out wildly toward the object that seemed to be a canoe
floating in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, Bob,&rdquo; cried Tom, presently. &ldquo;We
mustn&rsquo;t try to be too fast. We&rsquo;ll only waste our
strength. We&rsquo;ll need it all when we get there. Let&rsquo;s
calm down, now, and not get excited. We&rsquo;ve got
to keep our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as they surged ahead, with long, powerful
strokes, the voice again came, calling chokingly for
help. There could be no mistaking it now. It was
Jack Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;quick! I can&rsquo;t hold on long.
I&rsquo;m hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They quickened their strokes, and in a moment more
came in plain sight of Harvey, struggling feebly to
keep above water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on for a moment, Jack,&rdquo; said Tom, as they
came up to him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grab us, now. Let us do
the work. You just keep on paddling, what you can,
and we&rsquo;ll save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t grab you,&rdquo; gasped Harvey. &ldquo;Just get on
each side of me and let me put my hands on your
shoulders for a moment, till I get my strength back.
I&rsquo;ve swallowed a lot of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two swam up close, and Harvey reached up
and rested a hand on each shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swim for the canoe now,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let
him get hold of the end of that and cling on for a
few moments till he gets his breath. He&rsquo;ll be all right,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the overturned canoe, they helped him to
clasp one end of it, and then supported him there, as
they began to push it toward shore by swimming with
their feet and with a single hand each.</p>
<p>For a few moments Harvey managed to hold on,
but then his strength seemed to fail him and his hands
slipped their hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hold on,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s hurting
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then lie over on your back and float,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Just lie still and we&rsquo;ll swim you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey groaned at the effort it cost him, but did
as he was told, and they left the canoe and struck out
with him for the shore.</p>
<p>It was not such a long swim that they had before
them, but they had exhausted their strength more than
they knew in their excitement, and Harvey was well-nigh
helpless.</p>
<p>Before they had swum a rod farther, their breath
began to come hard and their shoulders ached until
it seemed as though they would crack.</p>
<p>Still they kept on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it all right, Tom?&rdquo; said Bob, finally,
panting the words out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound to do
it. Let&rsquo;s swim on our backs for a spell. Jack, we&rsquo;re
going to change the stroke. Don&rsquo;t get scared. We&rsquo;re
going to stick by you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>The words seemed to rouse Harvey, who had apparently
almost lost consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; he gasped, faintly. &ldquo;Let me go, I
say. I don&rsquo;t want you fellows to drown, too. Let
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he seemed suddenly to lose control of himself,
and clutched frantically at them, with the frenzy
of a drowning man.</p>
<p>They struck themselves loose from him, and he sank
under water, but came to the surface again, exhausted
and helpless. Tom seized him then by the hair. He
lay motionless, as though dead, and they took hold
once more and struck out again for the shore.</p>
<p>When they had reached it&mdash;they scarcely knew how&mdash;and
felt the sand again under their feet, they had
barely strength enough to drag Harvey a little ways
out of the water, and lay by his side on the beach,
groaning with every breath they drew.</p>
<p>This was from sheer exhaustion, caused by exerting
themselves far beyond their natural strength. They
were not strangled with swallowing water, so that after
they had lain there flat on the beach for some five
minutes they had regained their strength sufficiently
to be able to arise and lift the half-unconscious Harvey
completely out of the water and carry him up on the
bank. Then they sat down and rested once more, sitting
by Harvey&rsquo;s side and chafing his hands. They
lifted him up, although the effort cost them all their
strength, held him head downwards for a moment to
get the water out of him, then doubled his arms upon
his breast and extended them, over and over again,
alternately, as they had learned was the way to restore
a man rescued from drowning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>Harvey, who had never fully lost consciousness, revived
under their treatment, till at length they perceived
that he was out of danger, and needed now
as quickly as possible warmth and shelter.</p>
<p>There was no house near by, and it was clear that
whatever was done for Harvey must be done by
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t carry him, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; said Bob,
finally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get our canoe and paddle him
up as far as the Narrows in that. Then we can get
his crew over, and we can all carry him up to their
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bob set out on a weary trot down along the
shore to where they had hidden their canoe. Tom
waited by Harvey, trying to keep him warm, or, rather,
to restore warmth to him, by rubbing; but Harvey
was chilled through and through and shivered pitifully.
It was fully an hour, and seemed ten to Tom, before
Bob appeared in sight again.</p>
<p>They lifted Harvey into the canoe and set out for
the Narrows. Poor Bob was well-nigh exhausted, and
it was Tom who did about all the paddling. They
reached the Narrows, however, after what seemed an
endless journey, driving their paddles through the
water with arms that almost refused to obey the wills
that forced them to work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>When they had reached the Narrows, Tom set out
for Harvey&rsquo;s camp, leaving Bob to wait with Harvey.
Tom had not gone more than half a mile, however,
when he ran into the entire crew, who had become
alarmed at Harvey&rsquo;s long absence, knowing that he
had gone out in the canoe, and had started out in
search of him.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s white face, pallid with weariness, filled them
with terror, as he rushed up to them and sank down
on a knoll, breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Tom Harris,&rdquo; exclaimed Joe Hinman.
&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what is it? Did you see Jack?
Is he drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rattled off the questions excitedly, before Tom
could find breath to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, I guess,&rdquo; Tom said, in a moment.
&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t drowned. He&rsquo;s over there the other side
of the Narrows; Bob&rsquo;s with him. He is most dead
with cold, though. You better get him over to camp
quick or he will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were off like mad, on the run for the Narrows,
before he had finished.</p>
<p>Tom waited to rest a few moments more, and then
set off slowly for Harvey&rsquo;s camp. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough
of them to bring him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess Bob and
I have done about all we can to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had reached Harvey&rsquo;s camp, however, he
waited only to rest and warm himself by the brands
of a fire which the campers had left, before he began
to make what preparations he could to receive the boys
when they should return with Harvey.</p>
<p>There was a big pile of wood at hand, and he started
the fire up afresh, after having first pushed the brands
nearer the tent, so that the fire would send a comforting
warmth inside. Then he brought out a pair of blankets
and put them near the fire to warm through. He
hung a kettle of water on the stick provided for it,
and rummaged through the campers&rsquo; stock for the
coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>Presently the sound of voices told him that the crew
were at hand. Stepping to the door of the tent, he
saw the strange group approaching. They had not
taken Harvey from the canoe, but had let him lie there,
while they lifted the canoe and carried it along, two
boys at either end, bearing the weight with a stick
stretched underneath to support it. Alongside plodded
Bob, holding to the gunwale, to assist in steadying it.
They approached and set the canoe down, just outside
the tent door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get his clothes off quick, now,&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;I
have the hot blankets ready to wrap him in, and some
coffee when he is able to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a twinkling Harvey was stripped and rolled
snugly in the blankets, while Tom busied himself in
rushing up with cloths heated hot, and applying them
to the soles of his feet. After a time he lifted Harvey
up and poured a few spoonfuls of the coffee down his
throat. This seemed to revive Harvey, for he opened
his eyes, muttered something that was unintelligible,
and sank back to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; said Tom, passing his hand
over Harvey. &ldquo;He is getting warm again. He&rsquo;ll be
all right now when he gets his sleep out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Bob were thoroughly tired. They lay
stretched out before the fire on blankets for a time,
too weary to more than barely reply to the questions
of the crew as to the mishap that had befallen Harvey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>Presently Tom rose up and said: &ldquo;Well, Bob, it&rsquo;s
late, and we&rsquo;ve got to be getting started or we&rsquo;ll
never get back to the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be down again to-morrow to see how
Harvey is,&rdquo; he added, turning to the crew, who sat
a little apart, somewhat abashed by the turn of affairs
and the consciousness of the debt of gratitude they
now owed to the boys whom they had wronged.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send a doctor down if you want us to, but
I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any need of it. He&rsquo;ll be all right
by morning. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were about taking their departure when Harvey
struggled for a moment with the clothing that
enveloped him, lifted his head slightly from the ground,
and said, weakly, &ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Tom, as they stepped inside
the tent again and sat down beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Harvey, huskily. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
go. I want you to stay here to-night,&mdash;that is, if
you will. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got something&mdash;something to
say to you in the morning. I can&rsquo;t say it now. I&rsquo;m
too weak. But I want the crew to hear it in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Bob looked at each other in astonishment.
Then they nodded, and Tom replied to
Harvey:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jack. We&rsquo;ll stay. Go to sleep now.
You&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew quickly spread some boughs for them, and
brought more blankets from the yacht.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Bob, as they stood alone for a moment,
while the crew were busily engaged, &ldquo;it looks like
our revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, before they had the blankets half-wrapped
about them, they were sinking off to sleep,&mdash;to sleep
in Harvey&rsquo;s camp, alongside Harvey&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">A TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP</span></h2>
<p>It was late the following morning when Tom and
Bob awoke. The sun was well up, and the light
was streaming into the tent. Their eyes opened
on unfamiliar objects and on strange surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me the strangest feeling,&rdquo; said Tom, telling
Henry Burns about it some time later. &ldquo;At first,
before I was fully awake, I had forgotten where I was,
and I thought I was back in our own tent upon the
point. Then it flashed over me that that was gone,
and the next moment I remembered that I was down
there in Harvey&rsquo;s camp, and you can&rsquo;t imagine what
a queer feeling it gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey and the crew had already arisen, and Tom
and Bob could hear the crackling of a fire outside,
where they were preparing breakfast. Harvey had
awakened apparently as strong as ever, unharmed by
his terrible experience of the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bob,&rdquo; said Tom, as they looked across the
tent at each other. &ldquo;Do you know where you are?
Isn&rsquo;t this a queer scrape? I wonder what will come
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; answered Bob, yawning and stretching.
&ldquo;Oh, but how I did sleep. I feel as though I had
slept about a week. I never was so tired in my life.
Say, this is queer, isn&rsquo;t it? Who&rsquo;d ever have thought
we would be sleeping here, of all places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arose and stepped outside.</p>
<p>The crew paused in their work and looked up, while
Harvey advanced to meet his guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d let you have
your sleep out. You must have been played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; answered Tom and Bob. &ldquo;We thought
you were far worse off than we,&rdquo; continued Bob, &ldquo;but
you seem to have come out of it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey had by this time come up to them. He
paused, hesitatingly, for a moment, while his face
flushed. Then he put out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you shake hands with me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/pic6.jpg" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;WILL YOU SHAKE HANDS WITH ME?&rsquo; HE ASKED&rdquo;" width="500" height="770" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;&lsquo;WILL YOU SHAKE HANDS WITH ME?&rsquo; HE ASKED&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>Tom and Bob, for answer, extended each his right
hand and grasped that of Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Harvey, simply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve
it, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There may have been the faintest suspicion of
moisture about his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here,&rdquo; he said, and led the way to a
big log that lay near the fire, close by where the crew
now stood. &ldquo;I want to say something to you, and
so do the fellows, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an embarrassing moment as Tom and
Bob seated themselves on the log, while the crew stood
awkwardly by. They seemed uncertain what to do or
say to these brave young fellows, whom they now knew
had risked their lives to save their leader. With boy-like
reticence, they were too ashamed to speak.
Harvey broke the silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows and I don&rsquo;t know hardly what to say
to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The crew want to tell you how
ashamed we all are for the way we have treated you,
and they want to thank you for what you did for me;
but they can&rsquo;t begin to tell what they feel,&mdash;and no
more can I,&mdash;but they want me to speak for them,
too, as I&rsquo;ve been their captain in all we&rsquo;ve done, as
well as aboard the yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know what you did for me,&rdquo; continued
Harvey. &ldquo;I told them the whole story this morning.
There never was anything braver than what you did,
and they all know it now as well as I do. They know
you were as near drowning as I was, at the last, and
you wouldn&rsquo;t give up and let me go, but stuck to me
till the end, and couldn&rsquo;t have saved your own lives
if there had been another rod to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be here now, if it wasn&rsquo;t for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you would have done the same for us, and
so would the crew,&rdquo; said Tom, eager to spare the
other&rsquo;s mortification as much as possible, and feeling
his heart kindling toward his late enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I should or not,&rdquo; replied
Harvey. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m so much of a coward,
even if I <i>have</i> been doing things that look that way.
But that doesn&rsquo;t make our position any the better. It
isn&rsquo;t what we would have done for you in the same
danger that counts. It&rsquo;s what we have been doing to
you ever since you landed on the island that makes
our case so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; Harvey exclaimed, vehemently, as he
arose from the log, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been a lot of fools and
we&rsquo;ve been thinking all the time that we were smart.
It just came to me like a flash, as I thought I was
going down out there, all the mean things I&rsquo;ve been
doing and what a fool I&rsquo;ve been. I knew it all the
time, too, I guess, only I didn&rsquo;t care. But you fellows
have just brought it home to us hard, and we are
going to try to square things up all that we can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, first,&rdquo; continued Harvey, taking a long
breath and speaking earnestly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re sorry we stole
that box of yours from off the wharf. We knew it
was yours all the time, too, though I said we didn&rsquo;t.
Of course we couldn&rsquo;t help knowing. We don&rsquo;t blame
you, either, for blowing up the cave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t intend really to blow it up,&rdquo; interrupted
Tom. &ldquo;That was my idea, to burn up some
of the stuff, just to get even, and we were nearly
scared to death when the explosion came off. We
thought you were all killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe you now,&rdquo; said Harvey, &ldquo;although
I didn&rsquo;t before. I can see just how it happened, too.
The fact is, we had some powder and kerosene there,
hidden away. That&rsquo;s what caused it. Well, anyway,
we don&rsquo;t blame you for setting the fire, and we
shouldn&rsquo;t blame you now, if you had meant to blow up
the cave, too. We deserved it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry it happened, anyway,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; added Harvey, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another thing, and
that&rsquo;s the tent. Of course you knew we took it, although
you couldn&rsquo;t prove it. You hadn&rsquo;t any doubt
about it, had you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;we did kind of think so,
although we couldn&rsquo;t be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you thought so,&rdquo; said Harvey, &ldquo;because
nobody else would have done it. However, you are
going to get the tent back all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not half so glad as I am,&rdquo; exclaimed Harvey.
&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m glad we didn&rsquo;t harm it. It&rsquo;s
safe and sound, and you wouldn&rsquo;t guess where it is
in a hundred years. It&rsquo;s up in the old haunted house,
stuffed away in the garret, under the eaves. We
didn&rsquo;t dare keep it and we didn&rsquo;t want to destroy it.
In fact, we had decided to put it back on the point
some day, after we had kept it as long as we wanted
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll set it up again this afternoon,&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Harvey, quickly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do that for you, that is, if you will
let us. We want to put it up in as good shape as it
was before. We&rsquo;ll feel better about it then, eh,
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; responded Joe Hinman. And the
others nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, one thing more,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;You saw
what we had in the cave. There were some things
that belonged to Spencer, and one of the first things
I do to-day will be to go up there and settle up with
him. Then I&rsquo;ll feel as though I was ready to start
fair again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now if you fellows will sit down and have
some breakfast with us, then we&rsquo;ll sail up right after
it and get the tent and have it up for you just as
quick as we can. We can&rsquo;t do it any too quick to
suit us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>So Tom and Bob seated themselves with their new-found
friends. George Baker, who had the fry-pan
all heated and a big dish of batter mixed, proceeded to
fry a mess of flapjacks, while Joe Hinman poured the
coffee. All the old enmity had vanished in a night,
and they laughed and joked as they sat about the campfire
like friends of long standing.</p>
<p>Then, when they had finished, and had shaken hands
once more all around, and Tom and Bob had departed
for the Warren cottage to explain their strange absence,
and to acquaint the Warrens with the new turn
of affairs, Harvey and his crew got sail on the <i>Surprise</i>
and headed up alongshore for the haunted house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried George Warren, as the boys appeared
in sight a little later, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I tell you, mother,
not to worry about Tom and Bob? You ought to
know them by this time. They know how to take care
of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the next time you go off for all night,&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Warren, a little impatiently for her,
&ldquo;I wish you would let me know about it beforehand.
I don&rsquo;t like to have to worry about you, and I can&rsquo;t
help it if you start off in that canoe and don&rsquo;t come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for not liking it,&rdquo; replied Tom,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll try not do it again. But we really
couldn&rsquo;t help this. We met with an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you didn&rsquo;t see the <i>Eagle</i>, did you?&rdquo; cried
George Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re wide of the mark,&rdquo; laughed Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve given up that hunt for good. No, we had a
different sort of an adventure altogether. Where do
you suppose we slept last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With Henry Burns,&rdquo; said young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down on the beach?&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t guess in a hundred times trying,&rdquo;
said Tom, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll tell you. It was in Jack
Harvey&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey&rsquo;s camp!&rdquo; exclaimed the three brothers, in
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Harvey&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they were off on a cruise,&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;Oh, I see, you&rsquo;ve been getting even, have
you? And how about the camp? Is it still there?
What have you done with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still down there,&rdquo; laughed Tom. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t do anything to it at all. In fact, the crew were
all there, and Harvey, too. We stayed there because
they invited us. And, what&rsquo;s more, we have just had
breakfast with them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Warrens stared at Tom in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had breakfast with Harvey and his crew! Oh,
say, you fellows, quit fooling now, and tell us where
you have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;listen and we&rsquo;ll tell you the
whole story. We&rsquo;ve been having our revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Tom related the story of the night&rsquo;s adventures.</p>
<p>Good Mrs. Warren fairly hugged them with delight
when they had concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just splendid,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a splendid
revenge. That&rsquo;s the kind that counts for most.
But I want to hear Jack Harvey tell the story now.
I know you haven&rsquo;t told half about the rescue. I
want to hear him tell how brave you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll exaggerate it,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our friend,
you know, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad enough you are all friends,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Warren. &ldquo;You must go and tell Henry
Burns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack Harvey and his crew had returned from
the haunted house, and had anchored off the point and
had brought the tent ashore, they found assembled
there to greet them the entire group of comrades, the
Warren boys, Henry Burns, and Tom and Bob.</p>
<p>There was a general hand-shaking all around, and
then they all set to work to pitch the tent. It didn&rsquo;t
take long to do it, either, for Tom and Bob had saved
the poles that had supported the canvas, and there
were hands enough to jump at every rope and bring
it taut into place. And everybody went at it in such
good spirit, and everybody was so pleased and so willing
to lend a hand, that the tent was up in its old
place again almost as quick as it had come down.</p>
<p>Then they rushed off in high spirits to the Warren
cottage for the camp-kit and the boxes and the blankets
and all the camp equipment, and packed it down on
their shoulders as fast as they had ever done anything
in all their lives.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Warren did hear the story of the rescue
from Jack Harvey&rsquo;s own lips, and was prouder than
ever of her boys&rsquo; friends, Tom and Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>Then, when everything was shipshape, and Harvey
and his crew were about to take their departure, he
said: &ldquo;We want all you fellows to come down to-morrow
evening and take supper with us, the whole of
you. You see, I&rsquo;ve just got my allowance from the
governor, and he&rsquo;s mighty generous to me, more than
I deserve. It comes in just at the right time. You&rsquo;ll
be sure and come, all of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; answered Henry Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we will,&rdquo; said young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember Joe counts for two when it comes
to the supper-table,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have enough,&rdquo; said Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go along with you to your camp,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;and get our canoe. That is, unless you&rsquo;d like to use
it awhile,&rdquo; he added, slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; replied Harvey, with a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough canoeing to last me for a few days. But
I&rsquo;m glad I took that paddle, though, for all the narrow
escape I had. It was the best accident I ever had in
all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canoeing isn&rsquo;t always as easy as it looks,&rdquo; said
Bob, as they walked along. &ldquo;By the way, we haven&rsquo;t
even asked you how you came to upset. It&rsquo;s because
we have had so much else to talk about and think
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Harvey, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t much to tell. I
don&rsquo;t hardly know how it happened, myself. I went to
change my position in the canoe, as I was cramped
with kneeling in one position so long. I suppose I
lost my balance a little, but I was overboard so quick
I don&rsquo;t know, myself, just how it did happen. I must
have wrenched myself as I went over, for the minute
I tried to swim I felt a pain in my side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with a canoe,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t always tip over. Moreover it just slides out
from under one, without even capsizing at all. That&rsquo;s
usually when one is kneeling or sitting up on a thwart,
and the centre of gravity is high in it. When one is
low down in a canoe it is rare an accident ever happens.
We never have had a bad spill in several years of
canoeing, except when we got caught in the storm
this summer, and that was because a paddle broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had now reached the camp, and Tom and Bob
launched their canoe and paddled away. They did
not return to their own camp, however, but headed
down the island. When they had reached the Narrows
they carried across into the other bay, and then started
down along the shore at a good clip. They were in
search of Harvey&rsquo;s canoe.</p>
<p>Several miles down they found it, lodged gently on
a projecting ledge. It was uninjured, beyond a little
scraping of paint from the canvas, and they took it in
tow and returned to the Narrows. They carried both
canoes across, and then, when they had paddled up
toward Harvey&rsquo;s camp a way, they took his canoe up
on shore and left it.</p>
<p>That night, when Harvey&rsquo;s camp was asleep, they
paddled down quietly, got the canoe, and towed it out
to the yacht <i>Surprise</i>. They lifted it aboard and left
it there, for Harvey to find in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just as much fun in that kind of a joke,
after all, if one only looks at it that way,&rdquo; said Tom,
as they paddled home to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! but it seems good to be back in the old tent
once more, eh, Tom?&rdquo; exclaimed Bob, as they turned
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good? Good&rsquo;s no name for it,&rdquo; returned his
chum. &ldquo;The Warren cottage is fine, but I like to
hear those waves creeping up on the beach as though
they were coming clear into the tent. It just puts
me to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment bore truth to this assertion.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, as the sun was just sinking
down through the trees beyond Harvey&rsquo;s camp, a band
of six boys marched along the shore and through the
woods, singing as they went. If they had not known
every inch of the way as they did know it, a beacon-light
on the shore would have guided them.</p>
<p>All afternoon Harvey and his crew had worked,
making preparations to receive them. They had gathered
wood, lugged water, brought stuff down from the
village, brought in the lantern from the yacht to aid
in the illumination, and had, indeed, laid themselves
out to do honour to their guests.</p>
<p>Harvey extended a hand to welcome them, one by
one, as they came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a fine joke you played on us last night,&rdquo;
he said, warmly, as Tom and Bob appeared. &ldquo;If you
fellows keep piling it on, you&rsquo;ll have me buried under
a debt of gratitude that I never can attempt to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though you had made a good start at it,&rdquo;
said Bob, pointing to one of the benches, where a huge
supply of food lay heaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Harvey, &ldquo;just watch Joe now.
He&rsquo;s going to give us a treat. If any one knows
how to broil a chicken over the coals, it&rsquo;s Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Joe, thus distinguished, had raked over a bed of
glowing coals, the product of a heap of ship&rsquo;s timbers,
nearly consumed, and was preparing to lay out the
aforesaid chickens, split for broiling, upon a big wire
broiler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s half a dozen of them,&rdquo; said Harvey, &ldquo;and
they&rsquo;re the best that the island affords. You needn&rsquo;t
be afraid&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t confiscate them, either. We&rsquo;re
all done with that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they smell good!&rdquo; said young Joe, gleefully.</p>
<p>Soon they had a great dish of the chickens on the
table, flanked by a heaping plate of potatoes, baked
in ashes, a pot or two of jelly, several loaves of bread,
and coffee that filled the woods with fragrance.</p>
<p>Then they fell to and ate like wolves. If young
Joe had any the best of it, it was hard to see,&mdash;and
nobody cared, anyway, for every one did his level
best.</p>
<p>And then, when they had eaten, they sat and sang,
roaring away at the top of their lungs, for it was a
fair place for noise and no one to be disturbed; only
the fish-hawks high in their nests and the seals away out
on the ledges to wonder at the unusual disturbance.
Then, as the fire blazed, they told stories of fishing,
of hunting, of the search for the strange yacht, and
a hundred other things, more than ever fascinating,
heard under the stars, in the shadow of the woods,
in the sight and sound of the sea, by the firelight.</p>
<p>It was a night long to be remembered, although as
yet they did not dream of those events soon to happen,
which would be far more memorable, and of which
this evening by the camp-fire was but the beginning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRE</span></h2>
<p>It was nearly midnight when the boys came over
the hill, and the half-moon was just sinking out
of sight. They strolled down past the hotel,
whistling a college tune in chorus. The hotel stood
out, a big, black, indefinite object in the enveloping
darkness, for the lights had been out for nearly two
hours, and the guests were supposed to be all abed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; exclaimed Henry Burns, pointing to a
faint gleam that shone from a basement window.
&ldquo;John Carr has forgotten to put out his lamps in the
billiard-room. Old Witham will give him fits when
he finds them burning in the morning. Wait a moment,
and I&rsquo;ll just slip in through this window and put them
out for him. If the colonel should find them, just as
likely as not he would discharge John for wasting five
cents&rsquo; worth of oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Henry Burns, with the best of intentions,
shoved up the sash and crawled into the billiard-room
in the basement.</p>
<p>The boys stood around the window, waiting for
him to return, but one and all thrust their heads into
the open window as Henry Burns suddenly gave a
whistle of surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; he called, turning the lights up
stronger instead of extinguishing them. &ldquo;Look what
John Carr&rsquo;s done. He&rsquo;s left all the balls and cues
out, instead of locking them up. Wouldn&rsquo;t the colonel
be furious? I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. Old Witham
always drives us out of the billiard-room, so we&rsquo;ll
just stop and play one game now and I&rsquo;ll make it all
right with John Carr. He wouldn&rsquo;t care, and he will
be glad enough to have things put to rights, so Witham
won&rsquo;t find them out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Warren, as the eldest of the brothers, demurred
at first. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been up to enough pranks
this summer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t want to get
into any more trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not going to do any harm,&rdquo; persisted
Henry Burns. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll only play one game, just for
the lark of playing at this time of night, and to get
ahead of old Witham; and then we&rsquo;ll put everything
away shipshape and put out the lights, and no harm
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take much argument to influence them;
and in a moment they were all inside, each equipped
with a cue, and engaged in the forbidden game. The
time passed faster than they knew, and one o&rsquo;clock
found them there still.</p>
<p>But, late as it was, a most unusual hour for any
Southport dweller to be astir and abroad, there were
at least three individuals who were not abed and asleep;
and with these three we shall have to do in turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>It so happened on this morning that Squire Brackett
had important business that took him across to Cape
Revere, on the mainland; and, as no steamer was due
to run across till afternoon, and he must be there in
the morning, he had arranged to sail over, taking
advantage of the ebb-tide, which served strongest
shortly after midnight. He was sleepy and surly as
he came down the road, but paused a moment in his
haste as he caught the gleam of light and heard the
sound of subdued voices from the half-opened basement
window.</p>
<p>Squire Brackett stole up softly and peered inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, under his breath. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s
the way the young rascals treat Colonel Witham, is it?
I&rsquo;ll just see about that in the morning. I fancy Colonel
Witham will have something to say about this
breaking and entering. I&rsquo;d call him down now and
trap them at their game, if it wasn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;d lose a
tide and a twenty-dollar bargain by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the squire tiptoed craftily away, chuckling
maliciously to himself at the thought of how he would
aid in punishing the boys on the morrow.</p>
<p>The second man of the three who were to figure in
the night&rsquo;s adventure had set out some two hours ago
from afar down the island on the obscure western
side. If any of the boys had seen him rowing in
from a yacht anchored just off shore, had seen him
land on the beach and drag his boat well up on it with
supreme strength, and had seen him set off through
the fields and along the strips of beaches of the coves,
if any of the boys had seen all this and had looked
carefully into his forbidding face, with its malign, evil
expression, it is probable that that boy might and
would have seen a striking resemblance to that same
individual whom he had seen in flight on a certain
evening, and have wondered and feared what business
could bring him back to the scene of former danger at
this hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>Not being seen by them, nor by anybody else, the
man slunk along, now running, as a clear stretch of
field opened up before him, now thrusting his way
through clumps of alders, now skirting the shore of
some little inlet.</p>
<p>At length he struck fairly across the island, directly
toward the very town from which, a few weeks ago,
he had made so hurried an exit. Coming finally in
view of the hotel, he squatted down in the grass and
surveyed the prospect long and carefully before approaching
nearer.</p>
<p>Squire Brackett, going on down to the hotel, would
not have been so much at ease had he felt the presence
of this evil figure, crouching within a few feet of him
as he went by, and following stealthily in his footsteps,
pausing as he paused, and watching him wonderingly
as he peered into the window at the boys.</p>
<p>Now, as the squire went on his way, the man, himself,
crawled up to the window and cast a quick glance
within.</p>
<p>What he saw clearly startled him, for he had expected
to find the hotel in utter darkness. He seemed
to hesitate for a moment, then quickly drew away from
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t
stop me, and if only some one has seen them there
they&rsquo;ll get the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>Stealing around to the second window distant from
where the light came, the man took a short piece of
iron from a coat pocket and proceeded to pry the
window open. Its flimsy lock broke easily under the
pressure, and he sprang inside. He may have known
where he should find himself, for in the darkness he
appeared at home. It was the hotel&rsquo;s storeroom, and
was crowded with a litter of boxes and barrels; loose
straw lay in profusion, and a barrel or two of oil
stood in one corner.</p>
<p>It was scarce a moment from the time the man had
entered till he sprang out again. But now his manner
was altered. No longer proceeding with caution, he
started on a run for the fields whence he had come,
holding his arms hard to his sides as he ran.</p>
<p>Up the long slope of the hill he dashed, breathing
hard, rather, it would seem, from some deep excitement
than from the exertion. So he went on without
interruption for nearly a mile. Had he seemed less
beset by some fear that drove him recklessly on, and
been more mindful of his road, he might have avoided
the third person who was abroad this night, and who
now suddenly loomed large in it.</p>
<p>Plunging desperately along through the rough pasture,
following an uncertain path as it wound in and
among clumps of cedars and alders, the man all at
once ran full tilt into another man, or, rather, a large,
heavy-set youth, and, clutching at each other, they
both fell sprawling upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack Harvey, for he it was,
&ldquo;you seem in a confounded hurry, my friend, and
that&rsquo;s something new on this island, I&rsquo;ll be bound.
Why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo; but, as they scrambled up together,
Jack Harvey grumbling, but inclined to treat
the incident as a rough joke, the man lunged out
heavily at him with his fist and struck him full in
the face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>Jack Harvey was no coward. He clinched with the
man, and they reeled for a moment in a fierce embrace.
But the man had muscles of iron, and, nerved to desperation,
more than matched Harvey. Presently he
threw the youth to the ground, and as Harvey struggled
to his feet again he dealt him a blow between the
eyes that stretched him flat, and for a moment stunned
him.</p>
<p>Before Harvey had regained his feet and collected
his senses, the man was off, running harder now than
ever.</p>
<p>When Harvey finally stood upright, his first impulse
was to set out in pursuit of his mysterious adversary.
On second thought he paused a moment to consider
the matter.</p>
<p>Who could the stranger be, and where could he be
going? There was one thing Jack Harvey did know.
He knew every living soul on all the island, man and
boy, and this man was not of them. There was not a
fisherman along this part of the coast with whom
Harvey had not cast a line or raced with his yacht,
the <i>Surprise</i>. He had looked the man fair in the face
twice in their struggle, and thought for the moment
that he had never seen him before.</p>
<p>He had come from some other island, or the mainland,
then, and, as was evident, he was in desperate
haste to return. He must, then, have a boat, presumably
a sailboat, waiting for him, and that boat
must be moored somewhere along the western shore
of the island. The man&rsquo;s haste and fear of being
delayed argued that he had been up to some bad business,
&ldquo;Thieving at the hotel, perhaps,&rdquo; said Harvey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>And then Harvey, knowing every bush and tree and
nook and corner, and every rock and cove on all the
shores of the island, ran over quickly in his mind the
inlets along the coast, to pick out the most likely spot
he knew of where a man might choose to moor his
yacht and steal ashore; and the proof of his accurate
knowledge was that the mental picture he drew of the
place was that very cove toward which the stranger
was now travelling, and where there lay snugly at
anchor the strange yacht.</p>
<p>With this clearly in mind, Jack Harvey resolved
to follow in pursuit, although the man had now some
ten minutes the start. Harvey had the advantage,
however, that, whereas the man knew only the general
direction he must take, to Harvey every inch of the
way was as familiar as the ground around his own
camp. For instance, he knew, when the way led
through Captain Coombs&rsquo;s grove of woods, that
through the centre, the most direct way, it was boggy
and hard travelling, and that one could save from one
to three minutes by skirting along the end nearest
the town, and going through there in a smoothly
travelled path.</p>
<p>Again, and most profitable of all, there was full five
minutes to be gained by swimming the narrow opening
of Gull Cove, instead of following the line of the shore
in the way it spread out in the shape of a huge pear.
At the point which the stem of the pear would represent,
the passage from the bay into the cove, it was
only a matter of two rods wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>Jack Harvey did not even stop to remove his trousers,
blue blouse, and tennis shoes, but plunged in and
swam across.</p>
<p>What he had gained by this was soon apparent, for,
as he ascended the top of a low bank on the farther
shore, he saw running along the beach, not many rods
distant, the man whom he was pursuing.</p>
<p>Now the chase had become simplified and was easy
for the rest of the way. There could be no doubt of
the man&rsquo;s destination. Jack Harvey, covering himself
with rock and tree, made no effort to come up with
him, but took his time in following, knowing where he
should ultimately find him.</p>
<p>Presently Harvey left the shore, ascended the bank
to a roadway which led down the island, followed it
for a few rods, cut across a narrow strip of field, seated
himself deliberately upon a gnarled tree-trunk, and
looked out upon a tiny inlet that was just discernible
through the bushes.</p>
<p>There, of a certainty, lay a pretty sloop at anchor,
and presently there came to Harvey&rsquo;s ears the creaking
of the halyards and of the ropes in the blocks as
the mainsail fluttered up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a tearing rush to get away, sure enough,&rdquo;
muttered Harvey. &ldquo;Now he is getting up the anchor,
and slatting it up in lively style, too. But he is a
stronger man than I am, there&rsquo;s no mistake about that,&rdquo;
and Harvey felt of two lumps on his head that bore
witness to the man&rsquo;s violence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had Joe Hinman and Allan Harding
here now he wouldn&rsquo;t sail away so easily. But that&rsquo;s
neither here nor there. I&rsquo;ll know that elegant hull,
however, and I&rsquo;ll know that slick-setting suit of sails
anywhere in all this bay, and I&rsquo;ll get even with him
yet. The <i>Surprise</i> couldn&rsquo;t catch that boat in a race
in a hundred years, but I&rsquo;ll catch him napping somewhere
between here and Portland, or I have sailed this
bay for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yacht, its sails filling to the light morning airs,
sailed slowly out from its place of hiding and faded
away into the darkness.</p>
<p>Jack Harvey, waiting a moment longer to rest,
started off on an easy jog-trot back to camp. &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
said he to himself, &ldquo;the <i>Surprise</i> must up anchor and
after that fellow before daylight. We&rsquo;ll catch him
first, and then find out what he has been up to. Perhaps
he is another&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, by Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Harvey, suddenly,
&ldquo;what a fool I am! How could I ever have forgotten
for a moment where I saw that face once before?
The man in the rowboat! Whoop! And that
yacht is the <i>Eagle</i>, as sure as my name is Harvey.
And that man is Chambers. And to think I came
across the bay with him, alone at night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold drops of perspiration stood out on Harvey&rsquo;s
forehead at the very thought of it.</p>
<p>Over hills and through woods ran Harvey, his arms
pressed close to his sides and his head down. He had
gone about a mile in this way when, upon emerging
from a dense clump of bushes and ascending at the
same time a little hill, he paused to survey the prospect
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>The sight that met his eyes astounded him. Up
against the black morning sky there streamed a broad
flaring of red, irregular and uncertain. Now it
streamed up in a widely diffused glare. Again it
darted up in a series of sharp streaks of red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Harvey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hotel and it&rsquo;s
all on fire! Now I know it&rsquo;s Chambers, for certain.
Now I know why he struck me down. Now I know
what we&rsquo;ll hunt him for and what we&rsquo;ll catch him
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey, redoubling his speed, raced for his camp.</p>
<p>While this strange chase of Harvey after the man
had been going on, even more exciting things had been
happening at the hotel.</p>
<p>Shortly before the time the man had run into Harvey
in the pasture and knocked him down, the boys
had finished an absorbing game of billiards, had put
cues and balls carefully away, extinguished the lights,
and left the hotel.</p>
<p>They were in high spirits at their harmless adventure,
as they walked a short distance together, and
then separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go along with you,&rdquo; said Henry Burns
to Tom and Bob, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll give me that spare blanket
to put down on the floor.&rdquo; And the boys locked arms
with him in answer, as they said good night to the
Warrens. They were soon inside the tent, and, too
weary to undress, threw themselves down with their
clothes on to sleep.</p>
<p>But scarcely had they closed their eyes when the
sound of persons running hard roused them, and they
recognized the voices of the Warren boys, calling to
them in excited tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>The next moment the tent was burst open, and
George and Joe Warren thrust their heads inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up! Get up, boys, quick!&rdquo; they cried, and
Arthur, appearing the next instant, added his voice
to the others. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; they screamed. &ldquo;The
hotel&rsquo;s afire and the flames are pouring out of the
basement windows. We&rsquo;ve got to give the alarm, and
there&rsquo;s no time to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Bob and Henry Burns groaned in anguish;
but the three sprang up and darted out of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we have done it? Oh, how could it have
happened?&rdquo; moaned Bob, as his teeth fairly chattered
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; answered Arthur Warren. &ldquo;I
put the lights out myself, and we didn&rsquo;t light a match
in all the time we were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to give the alarm. We&rsquo;ve got to see that everybody
gets out, and let the rest take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they started on the run for the hotel. The
fire was already plain to be seen, for the flames were
gaining the most rapid headway, and a dense cloud
of smoke mixed with flame poured out of the basement
windows.</p>
<p>They rushed madly up the hotel steps, found the
doors locked, smashed in one of the big front windows
opening into the parlour, and one and all crawled
inside, screaming &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>Almost the first person they encountered was Colonel
Witham, rushing down the front stairs to the office,
his red face looking apoplectic with excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he yelled, as he came down-stairs
two steps at a time. &ldquo;Some more of your practical
joking, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo; But then, as he breathed a
choking cloud of smoke that by this time had begun
to pour in from the direction of the parlour, he
changed his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, boys!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve
saved us this time. Scatter through the halls now,
quick. You can do it quicker than I can. We mustn&rsquo;t
let any one burn to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel was, indeed, out of breath and nearly
helpless, and could be of little assistance.</p>
<p>The boys needed no urging. They ran from one
end of the long halls to the other, up-stairs and down,
pounding on every door and startling the inmates of
the rooms from sleep.</p>
<p>The guests, rushing out on each floor into darkened
halls, and smelling the all-pervading smoke, were ready
to jump from windows in panic; but the boys ran
quickly among them, explained just where the fire
was, just what the particular danger was, and guided
them all to escape.</p>
<p>Thanks to them, not a life was lost, although there
were several narrow escapes. Once when the guests
had assembled and a count was taken to see that no one
was missing, some one exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s
Mrs. Newcome? Has any one seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a rush and a scurrying for the second
floor, but the guests were met on the stairs by Joe
Warren and Tom Harris, carrying the little old lady
in their arms. They had knocked at her door and had
received no response, and so, hurling themselves at the
flimsy door, had burst it in, and found her on the
floor in a dead faint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this will kind of square accounts with
the poor old lady,&rdquo; said Joe Warren, as they laid her
gently down at a safe distance from the fire. &ldquo;She
used to complain that we made more noise than a
band of wild Indians, and were always disturbing
her afternoon naps, but I guess she won&rsquo;t complain
of our disturbing this nap.&rdquo; Then the boys left her
in the care of the guests, and hurried back to the fire.</p>
<p>The fire had gained rapid headway, and there was
no hope of saving the new part of the hotel, at least.
The old-fashioned town fire-engine came rattling up
in charge of Captain Sam, but, though the guests and
villagers and the boys all took turns at the pumps, the
machine could do little more than throw a feeble stream
up as high as the base of the second-story windows.
The water-supply of the hotel, which was pumped by
a windmill at a distance, was of more avail, but it was
helpless against the headway that the flames had
gained.</p>
<p>Soon the whole front end of the hotel collapsed,
sending up a fierce cloud of smoke, ashes, and sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky we&rsquo;re not in there now,&rdquo; exclaimed one
of the guests. &ldquo;By the way, has anybody stopped to
think that we should all probably have been burned
to death if it hadn&rsquo;t been for these boys that we&rsquo;ve
been complaining of all summer? Guess we&rsquo;ll owe
them a vote of thanks, at least, when this is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be too thankful that everybody&rsquo;s saved,&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That all may be,&rdquo; growled Colonel Witham, &ldquo;but
I can&rsquo;t see so much to be thankful for in watching a
twenty-five thousand dollar hotel burn to pieces, and
I&rsquo;ve got the lease of it&mdash;&rdquo; But his sentence was
interrupted by a piercing wail that came from the scene
of the fire, and, following the sound of the noise,
one and all looked up in time to see a large, handsome
tiger cat leap from a window from which smoke was
pouring to a narrow ledge which was as yet untouched
by the flames. There it crouched, crying with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s poor Jerry! It&rsquo;s my poor Jerry!&rdquo; cried
a thin, piping voice, and old Mrs. Newcome, roused
from her faint, came forward, trembling and waving
her hands helplessly. &ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t somebody save
him?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He knows more than lots of these
boys. Why don&rsquo;t somebody do something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t erzactly see as anybody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter risk his
life for a fool cat,&rdquo; muttered one of the villagers.
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no ladder&rsquo;ll reach up there. Guess Jerry&rsquo;s
a goner, and lucky it ain&rsquo;t a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waving her hands wildly and moaning, Jerry&rsquo;s old
mistress was a pathetic sight, as Henry Burns went
up and spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t do much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll
try. You just wait here, and don&rsquo;t take on so. I
know some things about climbing around this hotel
that the others don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And he gave a quiet smile.
Then he suddenly darted across to the old hotel, and,
before any one could stop him, disappeared up the
stairs. Wholly unmindful of the fact that a human
being was risking his life for that of a dumb animal,
old Mrs. Newcome took fresh hope and screamed
shrilly, in words intended to encourage the terrified
Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</div>
<p>All at once the crowd of guests and villagers saw
a boy&rsquo;s slight figure at the edge of the hotel roof in
relief against the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; they screamed. &ldquo;I thought every
one was safely out,&rdquo; cried one to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Burns boy, and he&rsquo;s going to save Jerry,&rdquo;
piped old Mrs. Newcome. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A howl of indignation drowned her voice, and a
chorus of voices rose up to Henry Burns, demanding
that he return.</p>
<p>But, helpless now to prevent, they saw him coolly
divest himself of his coat, seize hold of a lightning-rod,
and go hand over hand quickly to the top. Then
he stood for a moment on the only remaining wall of
the hotel, for the rest of the roof, though not yet
aflame, had caved in and broken partly away from
the end wall.</p>
<p>Along this narrow strip of wall crept Henry Burns;
but when he had come to the end of it there was a
sheer drop of ten feet down to the ledge where the
cat crouched, wailing and lashing its tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back! Go back!&rdquo; screamed those below.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Henry Burns, paying not the least attention,
reached one hand into his pocket, drew from it a
piece of rope, which he proceeded to lower till it
dangled within reach of the unfortunate Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grab it, Jerry! Grab it!&rdquo; piped old Mrs. Newcome;
and, whether in answer to the familiar voice
or from an appreciation of the situation, Jerry fastened
his claws into the rope, clawed at it furiously till
all four feet were fast, and so, miaowing shrilly, was
drawn up to safety by Henry Burns.</p>
<p>Back along the wall he crawled, and, sliding down
the lightning-rod, was once more on the roof of the
old hotel. Then, with Mrs. Newcome&rsquo;s cat perched
on his shoulder, he shortly reappeared below, amid
the cheering of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never say you boys are bad again and ought
to be horsewhipped,&rdquo; sobbed old Mrs. Newcome, as
she fondled her pet.</p>
<p>But she got no farther, for a moment later the end
wall, on which Henry Burns had stood shortly before,
was seen to sway violently. Then, with a
wrenching and tearing, as of beams split apart, and
with grinding of timbers, it collapsed upon the roof
of the old hotel, and a few minutes later that, too,
was all ablaze, and there was nought to be done by
any one but to stand helplessly and see the flames
devour everything.</p>
<p>When morning lighted up the spot where on the
previous day the hotel had stood, the pride of the
village and the boast of Colonel Witham, the sun
shone only on a charred and blackened heap of ruins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE FLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Southport, rudely awakened from sleep as it
had been, and awake all the rest of the night
by so unusual and stirring an event as a fire,
was too much excited to go back to its slumbers, but
stayed awake through the morning hours to discuss it.
A group of villagers hung around the grocery-store
all day long, adjourning only now and then to journey
to the spot where the hotel had been, where they stood
solemnly contemplating the ruins, with all-absorbing
interest in the twisted and distorted fragments that
still bore some resemblance to whatever part they had
constituted in the structure of the building.</p>
<p>There were dozens of theories advanced as to how
the fire had started. The oil had exploded from spontaneous
combustion; rats had set the blaze by gnawing
at matches, and so on through the list of ordinary
causes of fires; but as for Colonel Witham, with his
customary suspicion of all human nature, he was sure
of one theory, because it was his own, and that was,
that the hotel had been set on fire. This he doggedly
asserted and as stubbornly maintained. The hotel
could not have set itself afire; therefore, some one
must have done it. This was as plain as daylight to
the colonel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<p>He fiercely questioned John Carr as to whether
any lights had been left burning, but John Carr was
loud and persistent in his assurances that the hotel
had been as dark as Egypt when he had retired for
the night.</p>
<p>But throughout all the discussion, that ranged
through cottages, along the streets, and that spread
throughout the length and breadth of the island, there
were six boys who were silent, who took no part in
it, but who kept away from wherever a group was
gathered.</p>
<p>They were a serious-looking lot of boys as they
assembled on the shore in front of the tent; so much
of anxiety and apprehension showing unconcealed in
their faces that one happening upon their council
might have read therein a key to the mystery. It
would have been a mistaken clue, of course, but it
would have sufficed for the village and for Colonel
Witham.</p>
<p>For a few moments not one of them spoke, though
each boyish brain was turning the one awful subject
over and over, vainly seeking the answer for a problem
that defied all attempts at solution.</p>
<p>Finally Bob broke the awful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it have happened?&rdquo; he exclaimed. At
which there was a universal whistle and a shaking of
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Bob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary
for us to decide in our own minds, the first thing,
whether it was our fault or not. Because, if it was,
I suppose we&rsquo;ve got to own up to it sometime or other,
and we may as well do it first as last.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better now, if at all, than later,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;They might have some mercy on us now, being
grateful that they didn&rsquo;t burn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but Colonel Witham,&rdquo; said young Joe.
&ldquo;Catch him being grateful for anything, with his
hotel in ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, Joe!&rdquo; exclaimed George Warren,
sharply.</p>
<p>The very mention of Colonel Witham&rsquo;s name was
irritating. It was only too certain that no mercy
could be expected from the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Arthur Warren, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not to blame,
so why should we consider that at all? You remember,&rdquo;
he continued, turning to Henry Burns,
&ldquo;how we waited after I had blown the last lamp
out and the room was absolutely dark, and we had to
stand still a moment till our eyes got accustomed to
the darkness before we could find our way to the
window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that,&rdquo; answered Henry Burns; &ldquo;and
not one of us lighted any matches all the time we
were there, because the lamps were all burning dimly
when we went in; but,&rdquo; he added, somewhat desperately
for him, &ldquo;that is not going to save us the
moment an investigation begins, if they have one.
The first time they begin to question one of us we&rsquo;re
done for. The moment they know we were in there
last night, that will settle everything in their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo; asked young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, more calmly, &ldquo;it means
that we&rsquo;ve got a twenty-five thousand dollar hotel to
pay for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</div>
<p>The proposition was so absurd that they burst out
laughing; but it was a short-lived and bitter merriment,
and they could just as easily have cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would our fathers say?&rdquo; said Arthur Warren.
&ldquo;Ours told us we&rsquo;d have to make our pocket-money
go a long way this summer, because he rigged
the boat all over for us. There couldn&rsquo;t any of us
pay for the hotel in all our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;d send us to jail,&rdquo; suggested young
Joe.</p>
<p>This happy remark was received with howls of
indignation, and the originator of it was invited to
clear out if he couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t send us to jail,&rdquo; said Arthur,
gravely, &ldquo;for, at the worst, we could convince them
that it was accidental. We may be nuisances, but
we&rsquo;re not criminals. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better, on the
whole,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;to make a clean breast of it
to father, and do whatever he says is best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it in a minute,&rdquo; said George Warren, &ldquo;but
when I know we didn&rsquo;t set the fire, even accidentally,
I hate to put all that trouble and worry on father;
because, you see, we might not be able to convince him
absolutely that we may not, in some way that we
don&rsquo;t know of, have been responsible. Of course, if
it comes to it, we&rsquo;ll tell him all,&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll believe it,
too. That is, he&rsquo;ll believe that we are telling what
we think is right, for we&rsquo;ve always done that way,
because he puts confidence in us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to keep out of the
way for awhile till this thing blows over some. Everybody
that sees us now will stop and ask us how we
first saw the fire and all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done that already to us,&rdquo; said George
Warren. &ldquo;And, luckily, we could say truthfully that
we first saw the fire from our cottage piazza. And
we said we ran down to your camp and roused you
boys. Now that is all right for a touch-and-go conversation,
but suppose they see fit to follow it up, we&rsquo;ll
soon find ourselves either obliged to lie or to confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a fishing-trip,&rdquo; suggested young Joe.</p>
<p>They looked at young Joe savagely, for each knew
in his own heart that it was running away from
danger,&mdash;but it was significant that not a boy objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been planning one for a week or more,&rdquo;
urged Joe, in extenuation of his plan. &ldquo;And we
needn&rsquo;t stay long. We can come back in a day or
two and then start right out again, so as not to attract
attention by being gone too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose a little trip down among the islands
wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad for our health,&rdquo; said Henry Burns,
dryly; but it was clear he had no great liking for
the plan.</p>
<p>And so, in a vain endeavour to escape from what
seemed to them a most unfair and cruel predicament,
and without realizing that it was the worst thing they
could do, the boys agreed to start early on the following
morning in the <i>Spray</i> for a cruise.</p>
<p>Much surprised was Mrs. Warren when informed
of their plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">[311]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And just as everybody is telling what brave boys
you were,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They all say that half the
guests would have lost their lives if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was worse than punishment, and the boys
groaned inwardly, for Mrs. Warren had taught her
boys to respect her, and they valued her good opinion
more than anything else in the world. They went off
to bed soon after supper, &ldquo;so as to get an early start
in the morning,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>It was early that same evening, while the boys were
at tea, that Squire Brackett stepped ashore from his
sailboat in a perfect fever of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it and I said it,&rdquo; he muttered to himself,
slapping one hard fist into the palm of the other hand.
&ldquo;When I saw that blaze across the water this morning,
and knew that it couldn&rsquo;t be anything else than
the hotel, I says to myself, &lsquo;Those boys have done it,
with some of their monkey-shines,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s just the
way of it. By Jingo! but won&rsquo;t Colonel Witham
jump out of his skin when I tell him what I saw
through that window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps them &rsquo;ere boys won&rsquo;t be&rsquo; so much inclined
to tying other people&rsquo;s dogs to ropes and drowning
them when they get caught for setting fire to a fine
hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, nearly bursting with the magnitude of his
secret, and bristling with more than his usual importance,
Squire Brackett hurried up from the landing
and lost no time in finding Colonel Witham and escorting
him in great haste to his own home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">[312]</div>
<p>There on the veranda of Squire Brackett&rsquo;s house
sat the two worthies, while the squire poured out his
news into the eager colonel&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Witham, when he
had heard it all. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got them at last and no
mistake. What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he added, jumping from his
chair and stamping vigorously on the piazza floor,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prosecute them, every mother&rsquo;s son, to the extent
of the law. It&rsquo;s breaking and entering, too,&mdash;forcing
their way into my hotel at night,&mdash;and the fire was
caused by their criminal act. That&rsquo;s serious business,
as they&rsquo;ll find before I get through with them. Blow
me if I don&rsquo;t take the boat for Mayville this very
night, and see Judge Ellis and get the warrants for
Captain Sam to serve first thing in the morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, colonel,&rdquo; cried Squire Brackett.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back here before midnight, and be all ready
at daylight to arrest them. Reckon we&rsquo;ll surprise
folks a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, chuckling maliciously together, the squire
and the colonel waited eagerly for the whistle of the
little bay steamer, upon hearing which they walked
arm and arm down to the wharf and went aboard,
with their heads together, in great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Their trip must have been greatly to their liking,
for some hours later found them coming ashore again,
evidently in a most agreeable state of mind; and as
they bade each other good night on the veranda of
the squire&rsquo;s cottage, the colonel might have been heard
once more to exclaim, exultantly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em
this time, squire! They can&rsquo;t get away.&rdquo; And so
strode away, caressing in one hand some crisp, official-looking
papers, which boded no good in their contents
to six boys whose names the colonel had given with
evil delight to the judge at Mayville.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">[313]</div>
<p>Very early next morning good-hearted Captain
Sam might have been seen at the door of his home,
his fist clenched and his face burning with indignation.
Colonel Witham and Squire Brackett stood by the
stoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, colonel,&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Sam,
hotly, &ldquo;you surely ain&rsquo;t going to ask me to serve
these papers on them innocent young lads? There&rsquo;s
some mistake, somehow, and the way for us to do
is to get them up here and just give them a talking
to; ask them all the questions you want. I&rsquo;ve watched
them boys for a good many summers now, ever since
they was little shavers no bigger&rsquo;n mackerel, and I
tell you they wouldn&rsquo;t do no wicked thing like setting
fire to a hotel full of people, and there ain&rsquo;t nobody on
this island mean enough to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come here asking you for advice,&rdquo;
sneered the squire. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a constable of this village,
sworn to do your duty, and your duty is to serve
these warrants, the same being legally drawn and
signed by the judge. That&rsquo;s all your part, and all
we ask of you to do. We take all the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a shame. It ain&rsquo;t the right thing to do,
squire, as you ought to know, having a boy of your
own. But, as you say, it&rsquo;s my duty if you insist, and
I&rsquo;ll do it,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the hardest job I ever done in all
my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">[314]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the tent first,&rdquo; said Colonel
Witham. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always two of them down there,
and sometimes more. If Henry Burns is there, I
just want to get my hands on him. I suspect he&rsquo;s
been fooling me all along and playing his tricks on
me, when I thought him in his room asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dew was still heavy on the grass and the sun
had not lifted its face above the distant cape when the
three men walked down to the tent upon the point.
Not a sound broke the early morning quiet, save the
cawing of some crows in a group of pines, and the
lazy swash of the sluggish rollers breaking on the
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fast asleep,&rdquo; whispered Squire Brackett.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give them a little surprise&mdash;just a little surprise.&rdquo;
And he gave a hard chuckle.</p>
<p>Captain Sam, at this same instant, casting his eyes
offshore and hastily surveying the bay with the quick,
comprehensive glance of an old sailor, gave a sudden
start, and, for a moment, an exclamation of surprise
escaped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Colonel Witham. &ldquo;Did you
remark anything, Captain Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Captain Sam. &ldquo;I was just
a-muttering to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at this moment the squire threw open the flap
of the tent, saying, as he did so, &ldquo;If you boys will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as he and Colonel Witham poked their heads
through the opening, the sentence was abruptly cut
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty!&rdquo; gasped the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; cried the squire.</p>
<p>The tent was, indeed, deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can they be?&rdquo; asked Colonel Witham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">[315]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered the squire. &ldquo;Up at the Warrens,
of course. They are there half the time. It
simply means we capture them all at once and save
trouble. Come on, Captain Sam, you don&rsquo;t seem to
be in much of a hurry to do your duty, as you&rsquo;re
sworn to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Sam was, indeed, in no hurry. He loitered
behind, stopped to tie his shoes, dragged one foot
along after the other slower than he had ever done
before, while every now and then, as he followed in
the footsteps of the colonel and the squire, he cast
a hasty glance over his shoulder out on the bay. What
he saw must have pleased him, for on each occasion
a broad smile spread over his face and a mischievous
twinkle kindled in his eyes.</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire strode along impatiently,
pausing now and then for Captain Sam to catch up
with them; but as they drew near to the Warren
cottage Captain Sam quickened his steps and halted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two will have to stay here,&rdquo; he said, with
an authority he had not shown before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m commissioned
with the serving of these warrants, and
I&rsquo;m going to do it; but Mrs. Warren is a nice,
motherly little woman, and I don&rsquo;t propose to have
three of us bursting in on them like a press-gang and
frightening her to death. I&rsquo;m just going to break
the news to her as best I know how, and I don&rsquo;t want
no interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, and with face set into a reluctant resolve,
the captain walked on alone, leaving the colonel
and the squire much taken aback, and too much
astonished by the sudden declaration of authority to
attempt to dispute it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">[316]</div>
<p>What Captain Sam said to Mrs. Warren only she
and he knew. There were no boys called in to listen
to what was said. There were no boys there to see
how Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s face paled and how the tears
rolled down her cheeks, nor to hear Captain Sam&rsquo;s
words of burning indignation as he tried to comfort
her. No boys came to gather about her chair, to
assure her it was all a dreadful mistake. There were
no boys to face the colonel and the squire and declare
their own innocence.</p>
<p>But out on the bay, with all her white sails set to
catch the morning breeze, the yacht <i>Spray</i> was beating
down toward a distant goal among the islands.
And aboard her were six boys, whose hearts were
heavy and whose faces were drawn with an ever
present anxiety. For a time they cast apprehensive
looks back at the disappearing village, but as the
morning wore on and no pursuing sail appeared, they
became more cheerful; and to forget so far as they
could the real cause of their flight, they talked hopefully
of the fish they expected to catch and the swimming
and other sport along the white sands of the
island beaches.</p>
<p>But although no familiar craft as yet followed
where they sailed, there was, far in the lead of them
and some miles down along the island, a yacht they all
knew, and in whose mission, had they but known it,
their deepest interests, their very fate, in fact, lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">[317]</div>
<p>Jack Harvey had lost little time in reaching his
camp. While he ran the fire blazed brighter and
brighter, sending an angry glare over the waters of
the bay and lighting up the country around. Looking
back now and then, he could see men and women
running about in the light of the fire, and the frantic,
though unavailing, efforts of the village fire department
to stay the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems funny,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;to be
running away from a fire, and the greatest fire we
ever had on this island at that. I never did such a
thing before, but I guess there&rsquo;ll be something more
exciting ahead than a fire before we get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey found his camp deserted, as he had expected.
Not a sign of life showed about the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all up to the fire,&rdquo; said Harvey; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll bring them soon enough, though I reckon they&rsquo;ll
be mad at first to have to leave when the fire is just
at its best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he began ransacking the camp, rolling up blankets,
tying them into compact bundles and hurrying
down to the shore with them, where he deposited
them in a rowboat.</p>
<p>He made a pile of the rude dishes that the camp
afforded, a saucepan, a fry-pan, tin dippers, and a
few tin plates, tying them all together in a bundle and
rattling them all down to the shore in great haste.</p>
<p>Finally he got a boatload of the stuff, and, jumping
in, sculled the little craft out to the <i>Surprise</i>. Leaping
aboard, he rushed down into the cabin, threw open
a locker, drew forth a big tin horn, which he raised
to his lips, and blew four loud, long blasts in succession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">[318]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The hurry signal will surprise them, I reckon,&rdquo;
he exclaimed; &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve always answered it before,
and I guess they&rsquo;ll come,&mdash;even from a fire.&rdquo;
And Harvey began stowing the stuff away aboard
the yacht. Then he proceeded to untie the stops
in the mainsail, and was thus engaged when a voice
hailed him from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, Jack!&rdquo; came the call. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter? Why aren&rsquo;t you up to the fire? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; answered Harvey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming
ashore. Are the others on the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the boy on shore, who proved to
be Joe Hinman; &ldquo;but they don&rsquo;t like it a bit. It&rsquo;s
a shame to lose this fire, Jack. Why, you ought to
see Colonel Witham. He&rsquo;s the craziest man I ever
saw, running around and begging everybody he sees
to rush into the blaze and save his old office furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe,&rdquo; said Harvey, as he stepped out of
the small boat on to the beach, beside the other,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got some work cut out for us that beats
watching a fire all to pieces. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about
it, but there isn&rsquo;t one half-minute to lose now. Believe
me, you fellows won&rsquo;t regret it,&mdash;hello, here are
the others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three other members of the crew, George Baker,
Allan Harding, and Tim Reardon, burst out of the
woods into the clearing, gasping from running, and
amazed beyond expression that Harvey should have
called them from the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">[319]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; said Harvey, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole
story just as soon as we get aboard and up sail. This
is the greatest thing we ever did in all our lives; but
it&rsquo;s the minutes that count now, and we have got to get
under way the quickest we ever did yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, as the boys hesitated, and Joe Hinman
ventured the question, with something of suspicion
in his tone that he could not all conceal, &ldquo;Why, Jack,
there&rsquo;s no trouble, is there&mdash;no trouble&mdash;about the
fire?&rdquo; it suddenly dawned on Harvey that this sudden
departure did have a queer look to it, and that
he was, indeed, open to their suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there is trouble, and it&rsquo;s about
this fire; but it isn&rsquo;t our trouble. The trouble is
for the man that set it,&mdash;and we are going to make
it for him. We&rsquo;re going to catch him. Now will
you hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we?&rdquo; exclaimed George Baker. &ldquo;Just
watch us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And every boy made a dash for the camp to secure
anything he might need on a cruise down the bay.</p>
<p>Harvey and Joe Hinman seized two big jugs and
made off for the spring, whence they returned quickly.
Then the entire crew piling into the small boat, they
were soon aboard the <i>Surprise</i>.</p>
<p>The anchor was up in a twinkling. The sails were
never spread in such time. Almost as quickly as it
takes to tell it, the yacht <i>Surprise</i> was under way,
and with Harvey at the wheel was standing out of the
little harbour.</p>
<p>Then, as they left the glare of the fire upon the
waters astern, but still flaming like a giant beacon
against the sky, Harvey, with his crew about him,
narrated his extraordinary adventure with the strange
man, and asserted his conviction that the man was
none other than the same Chambers who had fled
from the island not long before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">[320]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a fast boat, and we can never catch her
in plain sailing,&rdquo; said Allan Harding. &ldquo;She is full
half again as big as we, and she would sail around
us a dozen times and then walk away from us without
half-trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Harvey, &ldquo;and that is just why
I am so anxious to catch up with him before he gets
out of the western bay into the open sea. If we don&rsquo;t
get him in the bay we shall lose him. Now let&rsquo;s
overhaul everything, and be sure that something
doesn&rsquo;t break just as we come to the pinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little to be done, however, on that score;
for, however carelessly they lived ashore, they had the
true yachtsman&rsquo;s spirit aboard the <i>Surprise</i>, and kept
her shipshape. Then they set the club and jib topsails,
for there was not much air stirring, and they drew
the tender up close astern, so it would drag as little
as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have one advantage,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;We can
depend upon it, he knows enough not to try the open
bay and sail down toward the Gull Islands. The first
part of the way is clear sailing enough, but when you
get down just off the islands you come to the shallows,
and a man has to follow the marks to get clear and
safely out to sea. And then, too, the alarm is going
to be sent out just as soon as a boat from the village
can get over to the mainland. They won&rsquo;t lose any
time about that,&mdash;and Chambers is sharp enough to
know it. He knows the whole bay down below there
will be alive with boats, just as soon as they get the
news wired down to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">[321]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, Chambers will try to fool them.
I think he will come through the Thoroughfare at this
eastern end of Grand Island, which he must have
studied out on the charts. He will not dare to try
the Thoroughfare to-night, however, and if we can
only beat down to somewhere below the Thoroughfare
to-night we shall be well to windward of him in the
morning, and he will think we are a boat coming in
from outside, while he will still be beating into the
wind, if it holds from the south&rsquo;ard, the way it is
blowing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Joe Hinman. &ldquo;He cannot
make the passage out through the Thoroughfare in
the night, unless he knows the way better than I think
he does. It is a bad run in the dark, even for a man
that was born around here. We have done it only
once or twice ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows turn in now, all but Tim,&rdquo; said Harvey,
&ldquo;and get some sleep. We two can run her for
awhile. I&rsquo;ll call you, Joe, in about an hour or two,
to handle her while I get forty winks, but, mind, everybody
will be called sharp the minute we clear Tom&rsquo;s
Island, for no knowing what we shall see then at
any minute. Chambers will lie up in Seal Cove for
an hour or two, I reckon, if he has got down that
far. I only wish I was sure of it. We&rsquo;d go ashore
and take a run across the island and catch him napping&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">[322]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, George,&rdquo; exclaimed Harvey, &ldquo;how
do you feel? It&rsquo;s mighty lucky you happened to be
taken with that colic in the night, just at the right
time, and that I started out to rouse up old Sanborn
to get some ginger for you. All this would never
have happened if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; answered George Baker. &ldquo;I
could hardly walk when we first saw the fire, but I
just made up my mind I wasn&rsquo;t going to miss it, and
so I started out. When the sparks began to fly I
forgot all about the pain, and I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it
since. It&rsquo;s all gone now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later they were nearing the southern
end of Grand Island and coming in sight of a chain,
or cluster, of smaller islands, through which an obscure
and little used passage ran from the western
bay to the outer sea. Jack Harvey had sent young
Tim into the cabin to snatch a wink of sleep, and Joe
had come up, heavy and dull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go without my sleep this once,&rdquo; said Harvey.
&ldquo;Here, Joe, hold her a minute. I&rsquo;ll get a bit of rest
right here on deck, with one eye open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was growing light fast now, and they strained
their eyes for a sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we are in time,&rdquo; said Harvey, as they
came abreast of Tom&rsquo;s Island. &ldquo;He is not in sight.
We&rsquo;ll head out to sea a bit more, and cut into the
Thoroughfare farther down, for the tide will be high
in an hour, and we can cross Pine Island Bar. Then,
if he has taken the channel on the other side of Tom&rsquo;s
Island, we can still head him off,&mdash;unless he went
through in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Harvey, having relinquished the tiller to Joe,
stretched himself out at full length on the seat to rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">[323]</div>
<p>Thus they sailed for a short cut into the Thoroughfare
at a point where they could command the farther
of the two channels.</p>
<p>And, as they sailed, so sailed another and a larger
sloop, beating its way out to sea through the farther
channel. A man, powerfully built, and with a hard,
desperate look in his eyes, sat at the wheel,&mdash;and
he was all alone. The yacht cut a clean path through
the smooth waters of the Thoroughfare, and, as the
man looked at the coast-line along which he was
passing rapidly, he muttered: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clear passage;
a safe run to sea. And, once there, who&rsquo;s to say I was
ever in these waters? I said I&rsquo;d have revenge on this
town for what I&rsquo;ve lost, if it took all summer, and
I&rsquo;ve done it. The blaze did me good as it lit the sky.
Twenty minutes more and I&rsquo;ll be clear of this, and
good-bye to this coast for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as he said it a smaller sloop turned the
head of an island half a mile ahead, and came down
the Thoroughfare, running off the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">[324]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE PURSUIT</span></h2>
<p>Great was the rage of Colonel Witham and
Squire Brackett when they discovered that
the boys had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be only so much the worse for them
in the end,&rdquo; said the squire. &ldquo;The fact of their running
away is a confession of guilt, and will count
hard against them when we once get them into court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; he continued, gazing off on to the bay,
&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s them now, about two miles down
along the shore. Cap&rsquo;n Sam, you&rsquo;re a sure judge of
a sail. Isn&rsquo;t that the <i>Spray</i> beating down along the
island, just off Billy Jones&rsquo;s beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Sam took a most deliberate observation,
turned a chew of tobacco twice in his cheek, and then
remarked, laconically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <i>Spray</i>, sure&rsquo;s a gun. There is no mistaking
the queer set of that gaff-topsail. It always
was a bad fit, and it sticks out just as crooked like,
two miles away, as it does close on. Y-a-a-s, there&rsquo;s
the youngsters, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">[325]</div>
<p>Captain Sam did not see fit, however, though a
constable, sworn to do his duty, as the others had
suggested, to explain that he had seen the <i>Spray</i> for
the last hour or more, and that he had been conscious
all along of the precious time they were losing. But
a sharp observer might have detected him chuckling
down deep in his throat as the colonel and the squire
stormed and raged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we going to do?&rdquo; cried Squire
Brackett. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re losing valuable time here. That
little boat eats fast into the wind, they say, and we
have got to get started pretty quick if we expect to
overhaul her between now and dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! What do you say, Cap&rsquo;n Sam? You
know the boats in the harbour better than I do. Whose
is the best one to go after them with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-al,&rdquo; drawled Cap&rsquo;n Sam, &ldquo;if I do say it, I
suppose the <i>Nancy Jane</i> is about as good as any in
a long thrash to windward,&mdash;if she does belong to
me. She&rsquo;s big and she&rsquo;s roomy, and there&rsquo;s a comfortable
cabin in her for you and the colonel&mdash;for
I suppose you&rsquo;ll want to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Witham. &ldquo;I
should say we did&mdash;eh, squire? When these &rsquo;ere
warrants are served I want to be there to see it done,
and so does the squire, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I do,&rdquo; responded Squire Brackett.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go along with you, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you want to be getting some grub aboard
right away,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, with a fine show of
energy and haste, &ldquo;while I break the news to my
wife. She&rsquo;ll put me up a bite to last a day or two.
You can&rsquo;t tell, you know, when you start off on one
of these &rsquo;ere cruises, where you&rsquo;ll end up nor how long
you&rsquo;ll be out,&mdash;so you want to come prepared to
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_326">[326]</div>
<p>And then, as the colonel and the squire hurried off
down the road, he turned back for a moment to Mrs.
Warren, who stood weeping, and said, with rough
good-heartedness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you go to taking on, Mrs. Warren.
There&rsquo;s some mistake here. Depend upon it. I&rsquo;ve
known them youngsters ever since they was no bigger&rsquo;n
short lobsters, and I know they ain&rsquo;t got nothing
bad enough in &rsquo;em to go to setting a hotel afire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps there might have been some little accident,&rdquo;
he added, more conservatively. &ldquo;Accidents
always is happening, you know, and we&rsquo;re all of us
liable to &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve got to do my duty, Mrs. Warren,
bein&rsquo; as I am a constable of this town, sworn to obey
my orders as I get &rsquo;em, signed and sealed from the
court; but I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stand by them boys, all the
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you just go and get your husband down here,
quick as ever you can,&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll settle this &rsquo;ere
difficulty pretty soon, I reckon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see here,&rdquo; he said, in conclusion, &ldquo;if Mr.
Warren gets here by to-morrow noon, that&rsquo;ll be time
enough. And that gives you a chance to take the
boat up to-day if you hurry, and bring Mr. Warren
back with you. I&rsquo;ll sorter guarantee we don&rsquo;t fetch
up here again till to-morrow afternoon, so don&rsquo;t you
worry.&rdquo; And with a sly twinkle in his gray eyes the
captain took his leave, and rolled along lazily toward
his home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">[327]</div>
<p>He was still eating a hearty breakfast when the
colonel and the squire burst in upon him, hot with
impatience. But the captain was provokingly deliberate,
and finished a few more huge slices of bread
and a biscuit or two, and two cups of coffee and a
few of his wife&rsquo;s doughnuts, before he would budge
an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys can&rsquo;t escape,&rdquo; he said, by way of assurance
to the impatient pair. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t go across
the Atlantic in a little sardine-box like that, if it has
got a mast and a bowsprit and a cabin to it. We&rsquo;re
bound to fetch up with them quick enough. Have a
cup of coffee, colonel! Squire, sit down and drink a
cup of coffee! Mrs. Curtis knows how to make it, if
anybody does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the colonel and the squire refused impatiently,
and by dint of nagging and voluble persuasion they
got Captain Sam started, and the three went down
to the shore.</p>
<p>The news had spread abroad by this time,&mdash;thanks
to the colonel and the squire,&mdash;and quite a number
of villagers and cottagers had gathered to see them off.</p>
<p>What they said was not complimentary to the
worthy two, for the boys, in spite of their pranks, were
universally liked, and the whole village had not done
with praising them for their bravery at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and arrest Jack Harvey and
his crew?&rdquo; cried one of the villagers. &ldquo;Looks mighty
queer to have them clear out, every one of them, the
morning of the blaze. Dan French, he saw them
standing out by his point early that morning while
the fire was blazing its hardest. Reckon that looks
a sight queerer than it does to wait a whole day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_328">[328]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Well! I guess they had a hand in it,&rdquo;
cried Colonel Witham, as he stepped into the yacht&rsquo;s
tender. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hunt them up, too, later on. They
are all mixed up in it, I&rsquo;ve no doubt. Wait till we
get the boys we are after now, and we&rsquo;ll make them
confess the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly did look suspicious, this flight from both
camps and from the Warren cottage, just after the
fire; and the villagers, however well disposed they
might be in the boys&rsquo; favour, or however much inclined
to show leniency, could not explain it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been up to some of their pranks,&rdquo;
they said to one another, &ldquo;and somehow got the hotel
on fire. Colonel Witham must be right,&mdash;and, besides,
Squire Brackett says he&rsquo;s got the proof. He
must know something bad, or he would not be so
certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to this conclusion, reluctant as they might be
to come to it, there fitted, in startling corroboration,
the coincidence of their being the first to discover the
fire,&mdash;the first to give the alarm.</p>
<p>And the villagers sympathized all the more, for this
conclusion, with Mrs. Warren, as she took the boat
for home that morning, bravely keeping back her tears,
and receiving courageously their kindly assurances,
though her heart was breaking.</p>
<p>The <i>Nancy Jane</i> was a heavy fishing-boat, of the
centreboard type, big and beamy and shallow of build,
able to &ldquo;carry sail&rdquo; in the worst of weather, but not
so marvellously fast as one might have been led to
believe by the recommendation of her owner. However,
it was quite true that she could overhaul the
<i>Spray</i>&mdash;only give her time enough, and provided no
accident should happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">[329]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a bit of water in her,&rdquo; said Captain
Sam. &ldquo;So make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen,
make yourselves comfortable, while I pump her out.
She&rsquo;ll sail faster and point up better with the water
out of her, and we&rsquo;ll all be more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the colonel and the squire made themselves
anything but comfortable, fretting and fuming at the
delay.</p>
<p>The captain took it leisurely, however, yanked the
pump for ten minutes or more, to the accompaniment
of short puffs of his pipe, and then pronounced her
dry as &ldquo;Dry Ledge at low tide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire were neither of them
sailors; so they could only wait on Captain Sam&rsquo;s
pleasure. He finally made sail on the <i>Nancy Jane</i>,
got up anchor, brought her &ldquo;full and by,&rdquo; and they
began the long zigzag chase down the bay in the teeth
of the wind.</p>
<p>The breeze freshened as they drew out of the shelter
of the island shore, and down between the nearer
islands Captain Sam could see the line of breeze show
black upon the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a right smart blow by afternoon,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Colonel Witham looked up apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t get dangerous, does it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Captain Sam laughed dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re not much on sailing, colonel, are
you?&rdquo; he asked, by way of reply. &ldquo;Bless you! We
don&rsquo;t get a dangerous blow in the bay once in a summer.
No, you need not worry about that. There&rsquo;s
no danger; but I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we had a bit
of a chop-sea when the wind freshens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">[330]</div>
<p>The colonel looked more at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no sailor. I manage to make
the voyage down the river to the island, but that is
as much seagoing as I have ever wanted, and this
will be my first real ocean experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not what you&rsquo;d hardly call an ocean experience,
either,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, grinning from ear to ear.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and he said the words over to himself as
though they afforded him no end of amusement, &ldquo;a
slat to windward from the point to Gull Island ain&rsquo;t
just what one would call an ocean experience, though
it does shake a body up now and then in a blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner-hour came, and they had the <i>Spray</i> well in
sight, some miles ahead and pitching hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat a snack,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, who was
never so happy and hearty as when he had his hand
on the wheel of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>. &ldquo;Colonel, have one
of Mrs. Curtis&rsquo;s fresh doughnuts, just fried this morning,
make you feel like a schoolboy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the colonel, pale of face, declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t seem to feel very hungry just this
moment,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Late breakfast, you know.
Er&mdash;by the way, is it going to blow much harder,
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great shakes,&rdquo; responded the captain. &ldquo;Guess
there may be another capful or two of wind in them
&rsquo;ere light clouds out yonder. It may freshen a bit,
but that&rsquo;s all right. That&rsquo;s just what we want. The
harder it blows the more the <i>Spray</i> will pitch and get
knocked back. It&rsquo;s the kind of a breeze that the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> likes, plenty of wind and a rough sea. The wind
is bound to go down by sunset. It&rsquo;s the way these
southerlies act.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">[331]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By sundown!&rdquo; groaned the colonel. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
hours yet, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll tip clear over if this
boat leans much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Built to sail on her beam,&rdquo; explained Captain Sam.
But at this moment the <i>Nancy Jane&rsquo;s</i> bow snipped
off the whitecap of a roller somewhat larger than its
predecessor, and the spray flew in, drenching the colonel
from head to foot.</p>
<p>He yelled with terror. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re upsetting, sure!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn her about, Captain Sam, while
there is time, and start again when it&rsquo;s lighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Captain Sam, with a grin.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit shaken up, but you&rsquo;ll feel better by and
by. Just go into the cabin and lie down a little while.
That may make you feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it had been so many years since Captain
Sam had experienced the awful misery of seasickness
that he did not realize that the worst thing the colonel
could do was to go down into the dark, damp, musty-smelling
cabin of the old fishing-sloop. Perhaps he
really did think that the colonel would feel better for
it. But whatever his motive was, it had a sudden
and deadly effect on Colonel Witham. Indeed, he had
scarcely stuck his head into the stuffy cabin, had certainly
no more than gotten fully within, before he
staggered out again, with an agonized expression on
his face, and sank, limp and shivering, to a seat, with
his head over the rail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">[332]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to
die. I&rsquo;m awfully sick; never felt so bad in all my
life. Can&rsquo;t you put me ashore, Captain Sam&mdash;anywhere,
anywhere? I don&rsquo;t care where, even if it is a
deserted island. I&rsquo;d wait there a week if I could
only get on shore.&rdquo; And the colonel groaned and
shivered.</p>
<p>It was obvious there was no way of going ashore,
however, as they were some miles distant from it.
There was nothing for the unhappy colonel to do but
to make the best&mdash;or the worst&mdash;of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, colonel,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, pulling out
the stub of a black clay pipe, lighting it, and puffing
away enjoyably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em just as sick as you
are one hour, and chipper enough to eat raw pork
and climb the mast the next. You will be feeling fine
before long,&mdash;won&rsquo;t he, squire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the squire evidently had his doubts in the
matter, owing particularly to the fact that he was not
too much at ease himself, his response was rather
faint; and the captain was left to the entertainment
of his own society. He enjoyed himself for the next
hour or two with a sort of monologue, in which he
proceeded to analyze audibly the relative chances of
the little yacht ahead and the <i>Nancy Jane</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are doing surprisingly well for a small craft
in windward work,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They handle her
well. Still, the <i>Nancy Jane</i> is eating up on them. I
say about sundown we shall be able to run alongside&mdash;Hulloa!
If they are not changing their course to run
down the Little Reach! Thought they knew better
than that. Why, it&rsquo;s what they call a &lsquo;blind alley&rsquo; in
the cities. Well, I&rsquo;m surprised. They know the bay
pretty well, too; and, only to think, they go to running
in to a thoroughfare which really is nothing more
than a long cove. They&rsquo;ll fetch up at the end of it in
an hour or two, and there&rsquo;s no way out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">[333]</div>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s voice almost seemed to express disappointment
that the chase should end so tamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Squire. It will be all over
in a few hours now. They&rsquo;re running into a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the colonel and the squire were beyond interest
in the pursuit.</p>
<p>The yacht <i>Spray</i> had, indeed, started its sheets, and
now, with the wind on its beam, was running off
toward a group of small islands, or ledges, on a course
nearly at right angles with that which it had been
taking.</p>
<p>The boys had watched the <i>Nancy Jane</i> anxiously
for the last few hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are steadily coming up on us,&rdquo; George Warren
had said. &ldquo;Too bad we could not have got a few
hours more start. We might have given them the
slip then when night shut down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are not sure that they are after us, are
we?&rdquo; asked young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it looks pretty certain,&rdquo; replied his brother
George. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing particular to start the
<i>Nancy Jane</i> down here, and she is Captain Sam&rsquo;s boat
and he is the town constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what had we better do?&rdquo; queried Tom.
&ldquo;There is not much use running away, if we are sure
to be caught inside of a few hours. We&rsquo;d a sight
better turn about and start back, as though we had
finished our sail. That would look less like running
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_334">[334]</div>
<p>It was noticeable that, having once set out to escape,
they accepted the situation now fully, without more
pretence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to decide before long,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns. &ldquo;The <i>Nancy Jane</i> is overhauling us fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; said Arthur Warren, &ldquo;I know one
chance, if you want to try it, and if you are willing
to risk the <i>Spray</i>,&mdash;and I think it would save us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Arthur?&rdquo; asked George. &ldquo;If it is
any good, I&rsquo;m for trying it. I can&rsquo;t see as we have
anything great to risk, with a twenty-five thousand
dollar fire charged to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Arthur?&rdquo; exclaimed the others, excitedly.
It did not seem possible there could be any
chance of escape open, but they jumped eagerly at
anything that offered a faint hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, in his deliberate manner,
&ldquo;you know the small opening between Spring and
Heron Islands at the foot of Little Reach? Nobody
ever ran a sailboat through there because it&rsquo;s choked
up with ledges. But you remember when the mackerel
struck in to the Reach there last August, we all went
down in the <i>Spray</i> for a week&rsquo;s fishing. Well, one
day Joe and I took the tender and worked our way
clear through between Spring and Heron Islands to
the bay outside. Now the <i>Spray</i>, with the centreboard
up, does not draw very much more water than the
tender, and by dropping the sails and all poling
through, I think we can work her in clear to the other
side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">[335]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;It is the
only chance we have, so we&rsquo;ve really no choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he put the tiller up and threw the <i>Spray</i> off
the wind, while Arthur and Joe started the sheets. It
was this sudden man&oelig;uvre which had startled Captain
Sam.</p>
<p>They soon passed the entrance to Little Reach, two
barren ledges shelving down into the water, and were
well down the Reach when Captain Sam and the
<i>Nancy Jane</i> headed into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; cried Captain Sam, &ldquo;like an
ostrich sticking its head into the sand. Well, what
can you expect of boys, anyway? We&rsquo;ll overhaul
them faster than ever now, because this big mainsail
draws two to their one this way of the wind, and the
jibs aren&rsquo;t doing anything to speak of, the wind varies
so in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was smooth water inside Little Reach, and, as
there was now scarcely any motion to the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> as she skimmed along by the quiet shores, the
colonel and the squire began to revive a little, sufficient
at least to regain their interest in the pursuit.</p>
<p>They were about a mile and a half down the Reach,
and the <i>Spray</i>, not quite half a mile ahead, was apparently
at the end of her cruise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are at the end now,&rdquo; cried Captain Sam,
whose blood was up when it came to a race between
the <i>Nancy Jane</i> and another, though smaller, craft.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em like mice in a box.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_336">[336]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By George! look there, colonel&mdash;look, squire!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, excitedly. &ldquo;They have given it up.
There go the sails. It&rsquo;s all over. They may scoot
ashore, but the island on either side is nothing more
than a rock. Well, I vow! But I didn&rsquo;t think they
would quit so tamely after a game race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em smart for what we have suffered
to-day, eh, colonel?&rdquo; growled the squire.</p>
<p>The colonel grunted assent. He was not yet sufficiently
himself to be very aggressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are they doing?&rdquo; said Captain
Sam, a few moments later. &ldquo;Looks as though they
were trying to hide away among the rocks, like a mink
in a hole. They&rsquo;ll have the <i>Spray</i> aground if they jam
her in among those ledges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Spray</i>, however, slipped in among the rocks,
and was shut out from the view of the pursuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em hide,&rdquo; said Captain Sam, contemptuously.
&ldquo;That is a boyish trick. We&rsquo;ll be up with them now
in fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the <i>Spray</i>, hidden from view of Captain Sam
and the colonel and the squire, was not running itself
upon the rocks nor poking its nose, ostrich-like, among
the ledges.</p>
<p>The instant the sails were dropped young Joe sprang
out on the bowsprit and lay flat, holding a pole, with
which he took soundings as the others pushed and
poled with the sweeps of the yacht.</p>
<p>They ran the bow gently on to rocks a dozen times,
but a warning yell from Joe stopped them, and they
turned and twisted and wormed and worried their way
in among the ledges, turning about where a larger
craft would have had no room to turn, and slipping
over reefs that just grazed the bottom of the little
<i>Spray</i>, and which with two inches lower tide would
have held them fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">[337]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the right depth of water,&rdquo; said Arthur,
exultantly. &ldquo;Luck is with us this time, for certain.
An hour later and we could not have done it. But
we&rsquo;re going through. There is only the bar ahead
now. If we clear that we are free of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just ahead, where two thin spits of sand ran off on
either end of the two islands into shoal water, was a
narrow, shallow passage, where the water was so clear
that it looked scarcely more than a few inches in depth,
as it rippled over the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out!&rdquo; cried Arthur, as the <i>Spray</i> grated gently
on the bottom, &ldquo;We will lighten her all we can,&rdquo; and
they sprang overboard into water scarcely above their
knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Joe,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;you and Henry take
the head-line out over the bows and go ahead and
pull for all you are worth. George and I will get
alongside and push, and keep her in the channel, and
Tom and Bob can get aft and push. We have got to
rush her over that shallow place, and we must not let
her stop, for if she once hangs in the centre we cannot
budge her. The <i>Spray</i> is not a ninety-footer, but she&rsquo;s
got enough pig iron in her for ballast to hold her
high and dry if she once sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys seized hold quickly, and the <i>Spray</i>, lightened
of her load, slid along, at first sluggishly, and
then gathering speed, as the twelve strong, brown,
boyish arms pulled and tugged and pushed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">[338]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jump her, now, boys! Jump her!&rdquo; cried Arthur,
as they neared the shoal. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing it. Don&rsquo;t
let her stop, now! Oh, she mustn&rsquo;t stop! We&rsquo;ve got
to put her over or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the little <i>Spray</i> seemed to feel the thrill and
joy of freedom throughout its timbers; for at the
words it surged forward with a rush, as though it
would take the bar at a flying leap. The white sands
reached up from the bottom, and the whole bar seemed
to be rising up to hold the boat prisoner, as the water
shoaled. But the little <i>Spray</i> kept on.</p>
<p>It hung for one brief, breathless moment almost
balanced on the middle of the bar, and the white sands
thought they had it fast; but the next moment it slid
gently from their grasp, gave a sort of spring as it
felt itself slipping free, and the next moment rode
easily in clear water, just over the bar.</p>
<p>The next instant six exultant boys, their faces blazing
with excitement and exertion, had scrambled
aboard, falling over one another in their eagerness to
seize the halyards.</p>
<p>They hoisted the sails on the <i>Spray</i> again in a way
that would have made Captain Sam himself sing their
praises, and now, with evening coming on, there was
just enough breeze left in among the rocks to waft
them gently along out of the inlet.</p>
<p>They watched breathlessly, as they neared the entrance
to the outer bay, for a glimpse of the <i>Nancy
Jane</i>; but the <i>Nancy Jane</i>, good boat though she was,
was just a moment too late. Scarcely had they turned
the little bluff and were hidden behind it, on their way
whither they might choose, when the <i>Nancy Jane</i>
rounded to at the entrance to the channel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">[339]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all done,&rdquo; Captain Sam had exclaimed, as he
threw the wheel of the <i>Nancy Jane</i> over and came up
into the wind, but when he looked to see the <i>Spray</i>,
she was not there. Not so much as a scrap of a sail
nor the merest fragment of a hull, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Captain Sam was so dumfounded he could only
gasp and stare vacantly at the place where, by all
rights, the <i>Spray</i> ought to be.</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire, who had no preconceived
ideas about the passage between the islands,
solved the problem at once; but not so the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone through there, you idiot,&rdquo; exclaimed
the squire, growing red in the face. &ldquo;Where else can
they be? They can&rsquo;t fly, can they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain groaned, as one whose pride had been
cruelly smitten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve sailed these
waters, man and boy, for forty years, only to be fooled
by a parcel of schoolboys from the city. Why, every
boy in Southport knows you can&rsquo;t run a sailboat
through between Heron and Spring Islands. There
ain&rsquo;t enough water there at high tide to drown a
sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems they got through easy enough,&rdquo;
answered the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; responded the captain,
warmly. &ldquo;They do say as how fools rush in where
angels don&rsquo;t durst to go, and sometimes the fools
blunder through all right. And here&rsquo;s these boys gone
and done what I&rsquo;d a sworn a million times couldn&rsquo;t be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">[340]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we probably can get through, too, if we
only go ahead and try, instead of lying here like jellyfish,&rdquo;
exclaimed the squire. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Sam, seems as
though you weren&rsquo;t so dreadful anxious to catch up
with them youngsters as you might be. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you
might have told Mrs. Warren back there a few things
that might explain this &rsquo;ere delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if them boys can go through there, I,
for one, don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s to hinder us,&rdquo; chimed in the
colonel. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Sam, I don&rsquo;t see what we&rsquo;re a-hanging
back for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, his pride humbled, and too mortified to
stand by his own better judgment, Captain Sam reluctantly
yielded to their importunities, and pointed
the nose of the <i>Nancy Jane</i> in toward the opening
amid the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; he said, doggedly, &ldquo;but if you
say that I am not trying to do my duty as a sworn
officer of the town, I&rsquo;ll just show you. Only don&rsquo;t
blame me if we&rsquo;re hung up here hard and fast for
twelve hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Nancy Jane</i>, like a horse that is being driven
into danger that it somehow apprehends, seemed almost
intelligent in its reluctance to enter the stretch
of reef-strewn water. It bumped and scraped its way
from one rock to another, balked at this ledge and
that, and, finally, after an extra amount of pushing
and pulling by the three men, jammed itself fast on
a reef studded with barnacles and snail-shells, and refused
to budge one way or another. In vain they tried
to bulldoze and cajole, to push and to pull, to plead
with and to denounce the obstinate <i>Nancy Jane</i>.
Stolid and deaf alike to entreaty and expostulation,
the boat squatted down upon the reef like an ugly fat
duck, comfortably disposed for the night and refusing
to be disturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">[341]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; roared the captain, now aroused
to his rights as skipper, and finding himself thus
exasperatingly vindicated as to the impassability of the
channel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hung up fast for the night, for the
next twelve hours, till next flood. Then, if Lem
Cobb is living in his fishing-shack on Spring Island,
and will lend us a hand and a few pieces of joist to
pry with, mebbe we&rsquo;ll get off, and mebbe we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire boiled inwardly; but as
it was apparent they had only themselves to blame,
they felt it useless to engage in discussion with the
indignant captain. So they wisely remained silent,
and left him to consume his wrath alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, finally, &ldquo;I for one am curious to
see just where those young rascals are; and if you&rsquo;re
of the same mind you can satisfy your curiosity by
coming ashore with me.&rdquo; And the captain waded
off to the rocks of Spring Island and clambered up
the bank, closely followed by the colonel and the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go, slipping along as slick as eels,&rdquo;
exclaimed the captain, as he and his panting companions
achieved the ascent of the highest bit of rock
on Spring Island and looked down the bay. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
off down among the islands,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and here
we stand like natural-born idiots and bite our fingers.
If ever I get into a mess like this again, I&rsquo;ll resign
my office of constable and hire out to Noddy Perkins
for a clam-digger.&rdquo; But the colonel and the squire,
too angry and chagrined for words, stayed not to
listen to the captain&rsquo;s denunciation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">[342]</div>
<p>They turned and walked rapidly in the direction
of the fishing-shack, the only shelter the island
afforded; while the captain, standing out in relief upon
the rock, like some disappointed Napoleon, was the
last solitary object that the boys saw as, looking astern
from the <i>Spray</i>, the little island faded from their view
into the twilight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">[343]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">AMONG THE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p>The yacht <i>Spray</i>, with six jubilant boys aboard,
sailed slowly away from Heron and Spring
Islands, shaping its course for a group of outer
islands of some considerable size, about two miles
away. It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock, but the southerly
breeze had not wholly died with the going down of
the sun, and the tide, which had just begun to ebb,
was favourable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can get across to-night,&rdquo; said George
Warren. &ldquo;This wind is going to hold for some hours
yet and maybe all night; and we know our way into
Cold Harbour at any hour of the twenty-four. I don&rsquo;t
think Captain Sam will start to run out of the
Little Reach at all to-night, for when the tide drops
there are some bad ledges all along that thoroughfare,
and, besides, he won&rsquo;t want to run the risk of drifting
out here in the bay, in case the wind should drop.
We shall have twelve hours start of him, anyway, and
once among the islands we can keep out of sight for
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have given something to see the colonel and
the squire when they found we had slipped away from
them at the very moment they thought they had us,&rdquo;
said young Joe. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they look funny, standing
up there on the rock, watching us sail away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">[344]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Sam has my sympathy,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns, dryly, and the very thought of the disappointed
trio arguing it out together sent the boys into fits
of laughter. They fairly rolled over on the seats and
hugged one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the richest joke of the season,&rdquo; said young
Joe.</p>
<p>And so, for the time being, in their elation, the consciousness
that they were runaways, fleeing from
possible arrest, was forgotten. The stars came out,
and a lighthouse far and near gave them their course.
The water gleamed with phosphorescence, and the
yacht <i>Spray</i> left a wake of gleaming silver and gold
and flashing jewels. By and by the moon came up out
of the sea and threw a radiant path across the waters,
and the islands ahead stood out in huge black shadow.</p>
<p>It was glorious sailing, with the soft summer night
air blowing in their faces; and they sang as they
sailed, and yo-hoed all the sea choruses they knew,
and felt so free and irresponsible that the yacht <i>Spray</i>,
as though it absorbed some of their spirit, rolled along
in a merry, swinging fashion, rocking gently from
billow to billow, dipping and tossing in time to the
music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">[345]</div>
<p>The still shores of Eagle Island rang with their
songs as they rounded to in Cold Harbour somewhere
near midnight, and came to anchor close to shore
in the deep water, within the shadow of the hemlocks
that rose up, tall and black, almost from the water&rsquo;s
edge, where the tide swashed gently against the rocks.
High up in the thick branches of the great trees some
fish-hawks, startled by the unwonted noise, rose up
from their nests and uttered shrill, piercing screams
of fright. And this was their only welcome, for on
all the island there was no other sign of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fairly certain they won&rsquo;t pursue us to-night,&rdquo;
said George. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t do to be caught napping.
We&rsquo;ve got to set watch regularly every night now,
and we might as well begin to-night. Somebody&rsquo;s
got to walk out on the point of rocks yonder and look
out for sails. Two will be enough till morning. We
will split the time from now till six into two three-hour
watches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin it,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My next,&rdquo; said Tom, not to be outdone by his
chum.</p>
<p>Bob rowed ashore in the little tender, and set off
at once for a point of rocks some half-mile distant,
which commanded a view of the bay. The others
were sound asleep by the time he was half-way there.</p>
<p>When Tom awoke, about seven hours later, it was
broad daylight and the sun was streaming into the
hatchway. He scrambled out in a hurry as Bob&rsquo;s
voice hailed him from the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa! Hulloa!&rdquo; came the voice. &ldquo;Are you
fellows going to sleep all day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come back and rouse me to take
my turn?&rdquo; asked Tom, reproachfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">[346]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t sleepy,&rdquo; answered Bob, &ldquo;and it
grew light soon, and I got to watching a mink fishing
for his family, and carrying cunners to them along
the rocks, and I thought I&rsquo;d let you sleep. It&rsquo;s tough
to wake up, you know, when one has just dropped
off. Come on, we&rsquo;ll take a swim now. The water is
fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom bared a muscular young form, and he and Bob
dived off the rail of the <i>Spray</i>, making such a splashing
and commotion in the water and bellowing so
like young sea-lions, that the others gave up trying to
turn over for another nap, and came sprawling out
of the cabin, diving overboard, one after another, to
join them. Then they had a race ashore, which was
won by Tom, with Bob and Henry Burns a close
second; after which they lay on the beach sunning
themselves, and then swam back to the yacht for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a sail in sight, and the whole bay is
as smooth as glass,&rdquo; Bob had announced on his arrival;
and, as not a breath of wind was yet stirring, there
was no need of setting watch for the present. So
they all sat down to hot coffee and griddle-cakes, and
ate like wolves.</p>
<p>After breakfast they went ashore to explore the
island, roaming about like young savages, leaving their
clothing piled in a heap in the tender. Every now and
then, as the humour seized them, they raced down to
the shore, wherever they were, ran along on the fine
white beaches, and cooled themselves in the clear, still
water.</p>
<p>They had it all to themselves, for nobody lived on
this small island, the fishermen on the mainland or
neighbouring larger islands coming over in the late
summer only, to cut the grass and make the hay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">[347]</div>
<p>Then they went back to the tender and dressed, and
Henry Burns, daunted at nothing, tried to climb one
of the giant hemlocks to a fish-hawk&rsquo;s nest, but gave
it up when the birds screamed in his ears and beat
at him with their powerful wings.</p>
<p>They had dug some clams at the low tide in the
forenoon and put them away, covered with wet seaweed.
Now, shortly after their noon luncheon, as the
tide flooded, they got out the lines from a locker in
the <i>Spray</i> and tried the fishing in Cold Harbour.
There were plenty of small harbour fish, flounders out
in the middle where the water was muddy, and cunners
and small rock-cod in among the ledges. They soon
caught a basket of these, cleaned them, and put them
away, covered with seaweed, like the clams.</p>
<p>Then, toward the end of the afternoon, as the bay
was still calm, they set out along the shore and gathered
driftwood, which they threw in a great pile on
a flat, clean ledge. As supper-time came, they set this
heap afire and let it burn for an hour or two, until
the great flat ledge was at a white heat. Then they
made a broom of some branches of hemlock, and swept
the ledge clean of ashes, and brought the clams and
poured them out on the ledge, covering them all with
clean, damp seaweed till there rose clouds of steam,
and, after a time, an appetizing odour.</p>
<p>The fish they cooked in much the same way, wrapping
them in big green leaves and setting them upon
the hot stones to bake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_348">[348]</div>
<p>Then, as evening came on, they built the fire anew
close by, for a fire is the cheeriest of companions in
a strange place, and sat feasting on steamed clams and
fish, with a great pot of coffee filling all the air with a
most delicious fragrance. They lolled about the fire
and ate, till even slim Henry Burns said he felt like
an alderman. They told stories by the firelight, and
stretched out at ease till sleep nearly overtook them
as they lay there; for the day had been brimful of
exertion. By and by, long after the stars were out,
and a gentle breeze from the south, coming up softly
from among the islands, just rippled the water, they
rowed out to the <i>Spray</i>, Tom returning ashore again
to begin the night&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>Then, later in the night, came George Warren&rsquo;s turn
to watch, and he stayed it out till morning, for, with
all the fun of the day, there was something that would
keep turning over and over in his brain, and which
took away the sleepy feeling and left in its stead a
feeling of unhappiness; a sense of something wrong.
His father would have said it was conscience, but
George wrestled long and hard through the morning
hours to avoid recognizing it as that, for conscience
would say, if recognized, that it was all wrong, what
they were doing,&mdash;and George Warren wanted to
think he was having a good time.</p>
<p>These moody thoughts began to dissipate, however,
with the coming of the warm golden glow in the east;
and when the sun was at length up, and the boys had
had their morning swim, and sat about a fire awaiting
breakfast, George Warren seemed himself again.</p>
<p>But the breakfast was rudely interrupted by a series
of whoops from young Joe, who had taken his brother&rsquo;s
place on guard at the end of the point of rocks, and
who now came running down alongshore, crying out
that there was a sail that looked like the <i>Nancy Jane</i>
coming out from around the islands across the bay,
and they all raced back to have a look at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_349">[349]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Nancy Jane</i>, sure enough,&rdquo; said Henry
Burns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her big mainsail, with the high peak.
She&rsquo;s making slow headway, though, with this breath
of wind. However, we shall have to be off at once,
if we are going to try to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was noticeable that Henry Burns said &ldquo;if.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as no one felt like proposing to give up,
they lost no time in getting aboard the <i>Spray</i>, and
had sail on and the anchor up in what Captain Sam
would have called a jiffy. Heading out into the open
bay that lay between them and the outer islands, they
bade good-bye to Cold Harbour and began a long,
slow beat to windward, in the light breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more wind coming, down between the
islands,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a line of breeze about
two miles to the southward, and we shall catch it a
good half-hour before the <i>Nancy Jane</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; it will give us a fine start,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>But, somehow, no one seemed wildly enthusiastic
over their prospects. However, as they caught the
fresher breeze, and the little <i>Spray</i> stood stiffly up into
it and ate away to windward, their spirits rose. Then,
as the islands came plainly into view and they drew
nearer and nearer to the first, big Saddle Island, with
its low range of little hills dropping down in the centre
in the shape of a horse&rsquo;s back, the excitement became
intense; for the <i>Nancy Jane</i> had not rounded the point
of Eagle Island, and it seemed as though they might
be out of sight behind Saddle Island before they could
be seen by those aboard the pursuing yacht.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_350">[350]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, old <i>Spray</i>! Good little boat!&rdquo; cried young
Joe, as the yacht glided swiftly up into the shadow of
the island. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make it, and, once behind
old Saddle, who&rsquo;s to know which way we have
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes more of this sailing, and we shall
fool Captain Sam once more,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>The five minutes were nearly up. They had but
another leg to run to round the head of Saddle Island.
They stood out till they had one and all declared that
they could clear it on the next tack; they were all
ready to go about. George Warren stood with one
hand on the tiller and the other ready to grasp the
main-sheet. Joe and Arthur Warren were waiting
impatiently to trim the jib-sheets, and then&mdash;and
then George Warren took their breaths away.</p>
<p>All at once he jammed the tiller over, threw the
<i>Spray</i> clear off the wind, let the main-sheet run, and
before they scarcely knew what had happened, instead
of standing in to round the head of Saddle Island, the
little <i>Spray</i> was running dead before the wind and
heading squarely back for the point around which the
<i>Nancy Jane</i> must soon come in sight.</p>
<p>It was so quickly done that at first they thought
there was some mistake, and Arthur and Joe and Bob
rushed to the stern to help bring her around again;
but George Warren, with a firm, set look on his face,
stood them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, George, you&rsquo;re not going to give it up
now, are you?&rdquo; cried young Joe, who had been in high
spirits not a moment before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_351">[351]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; responded his brother, quietly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it all out at last, and I&rsquo;ve come to the
conclusion we are doing the cowardly thing to run
away. We have got to face the thing, and we may
as well do it first as last. Besides, we didn&rsquo;t set out
to run away when we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We have sort of
drifted into this running away business without realizing
what we were doing. Now the best thing we can
do is to go back and have it out with Colonel Witham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Colonel Witham that I hate to face,&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s father and mother. And the part they&rsquo;ll
feel worst about is that we did not stay and talk it over
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; added Arthur. &ldquo;What a lot of loons
we were to come down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I pull the centreboard up?&rdquo; asked Henry
Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; answered George Warren. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll
take a leaf out of your book, Henry, and we won&rsquo;t
worry over what cannot be helped. We&rsquo;re doing the
right thing now, anyway, so there&rsquo;s that much to feel
good about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the <i>Nancy Jane</i>,&rdquo; said Henry Burns.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Captain Sam&rsquo;s pride was just turning
the point, and Captain Sam, looking at the <i>Spray</i>
coming down free and pointing its nose right at him,
could hardly believe his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them, all right,&rdquo; he assured the squire and
the colonel. &ldquo;They are coming back; tired of being
runaways, I guess. Well, I thought they would get
sick of it after a night or two away from home. They
ain&rsquo;t the kind of boys to enjoy running away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">[352]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; snorted the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a lot of young scamps and scapegraces,&rdquo;
snarled the squire.</p>
<p>Getting aground and spending a night in a bed that
the colonel swore was stuffed with pig iron and seaweed
had not improved their tempers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow,&rdquo; responded Captain Sam, &ldquo;they
are coming back of their own accord, and that is
something in their favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire only sneered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the little <i>Spray</i> came running down the
wind in merry style, and the end of the next hour
found her swinging up into the wind, with sails flapping,
while the <i>Nancy Jane</i> ran alongside.</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire were at last avenged.</p>
<p>Full of wrath was the one, and brimming with
wrathful satisfaction was the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we have caught you at last, have we?&rdquo; exclaimed
Squire Brackett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to have sort of caught ourselves, squire,&rdquo;
answered George Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind about being smart,&rdquo; said the
colonel, hotly. &ldquo;You are under arrest for burning
my hotel down. Perhaps that will take some of the
smartness out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under arrest!&rdquo; George Warren&rsquo;s face paled. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do it nor have
any hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you won&rsquo;t attempt to deny that you were
in the billiard-room, will you?&rdquo; broke in Squire
Brackett. &ldquo;Because, bein&rsquo; as I saw you all in there,
it might not do you any good to swear as how you
wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">[353]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare accuse us of trying&mdash;&rdquo; But
young Joe got no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Joe,&rdquo; said George Warren, calmly. And
then, turning to the colonel, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to deny anything, Colonel
Witham. That is why we are coming back of our
own accord. We have got nothing to conceal, and
we are going to tell everything just as it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just about what we are arresting you for,&rdquo;
said the squire, sneeringly. &ldquo;We calculate you&rsquo;ll have
to tell everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there a minute, squire,&rdquo; cried Captain
Sam. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not be too hard on these boys. There
may be some mistake, as they say. I hold these &rsquo;ere
warrants, and I don&rsquo;t see as there is any necessity
of serving of &rsquo;em just yet. If these boys will give
me their word to go along straight as they can sail
for Mayville, and agree to appear when wanted before
Judge Ellis, why, I guess maybe the warrants will
keep till&mdash;say, just as we go in the door. Or perhaps
Judge Ellis will consent that they come before
him of their own accord, without serving these warrants
at all, considering as they are only boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Captain Sam&rsquo;s legal experience
was of the most limited sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Captain Sam!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a brick,&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo; And a yell of
thanks from the others gave Captain Sam a warm
glow under his blue shirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_354">[354]</div>
<p>The squire and the colonel were loud and furious
in their denunciation of such a course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law,&rdquo; cried the colonel; and he
vowed he would make it hot for Captain Sam when
Judge Ellis found his orders were not obeyed. But
Captain Sam knew better than they of the warm corner
in the judge&rsquo;s heart, and knew, moreover, that his old
friend of years, the judge, would never reprimand him
for a breach of duty of this sort. So he shut his lips
firmly and let the squire and the colonel boil away as
best they might between themselves.</p>
<p>The captain shortened sail on the <i>Nancy Jane</i>, so
that the two boats kept along near together, heading
back for Southport.</p>
<p>It was a sorry crew aboard the <i>Spray</i> as the little
craft silently followed in the wake of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>.
They might have been in dreamland as they sailed all
that day, for scarcely a word was spoken; and when
night dropped down and the boys, all but George
Warren, piled into the cabin to sleep, it was scarcely
more quiet than by day.</p>
<p>Very late that night, as the <i>Spray</i> and the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> ran into Southport harbour and brought up for
a few moments alongside the wharf, to let a serious-looking
man, and a tearful woman aboard, the boys
were still sleeping soundly; and George Warren and
his father and mother sat alone together till the sun
rose, while the <i>Spray</i>, following the <i>Nancy Jane</i>, ran
along up the island and then stood across to Mayville,
where Judge Ellis would hold his court that morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_355">[355]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to make any denial about the
fire,&rdquo; Mr. Warren had said, when he stepped aboard
the <i>Spray</i> and put his hand on his eldest son&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;I know you boys would not do such a thing as
that; but I fear your recklessness has gotten you into
serious trouble, and Colonel Witham seems inclined
to press the matter to the extreme. So I want to hear
everything from beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And George Warren told him all.</p>
<p class="tb">There was another boat coming sluggishly up the
bay that night, far astern of the <i>Spray</i>, a handsome
big sloop, beautifully modelled and with finely tapered,
shining yellow spars. But she carried little sail, was
reefed, in fact, though the breeze was very light; and
she moved through the water so like a dead thing, or
like a creature crippled by a wound, that a sailor would
have seen at once that there had been some mishap
aboard, some injury to hull or spars that held her
back.</p>
<p>The youth at the wheel of this strange, big sloop
bore a striking resemblance to Jack Harvey, though
the yacht was not the <i>Surprise</i>, but bigger and far
more elegant. And the crew&mdash;yes, they were surely
Harvey&rsquo;s crew&mdash;George and Allan and Tim and Joe,&mdash;and
they addressed the boy at the wheel as &ldquo;Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the <i>Surprise</i>&mdash;where was she?</p>
<p>Four days had passed since, on that morning following
the fire, the <i>Surprise</i> had turned the point of the
island that marked an entrance to the thoroughfare
where, a half-mile to leeward, a big black sloop was
coming fast up the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_356">[356]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; Harvey had cried. &ldquo;Come, boys,
get into shape now; but stay below till I give the
word,&mdash;all but you, Joe,&mdash;and when I yell you pile
out and get aboard that sloop the quickest you ever
did anything in all your lives. He will fight, and we
have got to act quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the thick-set, ill-visaged man who sat at the wheel
of the black sloop felt any concern at the sudden appearance
of this new craft, dead ahead and coming
down the narrow thoroughfare toward him, his alarm
must have abated as on its near approach the apparent
number of its occupants became disclosed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks harmless enough,&rdquo; he muttered, between
his teeth. &ldquo;Pshaw! There&rsquo;s only a couple of
boys aboard. But it did give me a start for a moment.&rdquo;
And he slapped a hand at his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking long chances, if he did but know it,&rdquo;
said Harvey, as the big sloop came about after a tack
close in shore. &ldquo;That boat cannot more than clear
those ledges by an inch, if it does that. It&rsquo;s a regular
stone field where he&rsquo;s sailing. The channel here winds
like a cow-path in a pasture. However, if he can clear
there, we can, so we&rsquo;ll begin to crowd him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy matter now to close in on a boat
beating across the thoroughfare and not arouse suspicion.
To follow him, tack by tack, and point so as
to head him off every time he went about, must inevitably
put him on his guard long before the time came
to strike, and might even allow him, by clever sailing,
to slip by.</p>
<p>With his cap pulled down over his eyes, so that
the stranger could not by any chance identify him as
the youth he had knocked down in the pasture the
night of the fire, and his head bent low, Jack Harvey
watched the man&rsquo;s every move, and calculated every
inch of the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_357">[357]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three more tacks will bring him up to us,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s shoal water to starboard and some
ledges just beyond them. He&rsquo;s got to meet us about
in that spot,&rdquo; and Harvey laid his own course according
to his calculation and held to it steadily.</p>
<p>It must have served to allay the man&rsquo;s suspicions,
if he still had any, but now, as he came about on the
third tack, he viewed the oncoming <i>Surprise</i> with
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away, there!&rdquo; he cried, in a fierce, violent
tone. &ldquo;Keep off! Can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re going to
foul me if you don&rsquo;t keep off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready to jump, now, Joe,&rdquo; said Harvey, in a low
voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run him down. It&rsquo;s the only
way to be sure, though it may wreck us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; he called, softly, to the boys below, &ldquo;all
ready, now. You know what you&rsquo;ve got to do the
moment she strikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man at the wheel had risen to his feet, and he
shook one fist threateningly, while his other hand
clutched the wheel, throwing his sloop off as far as
he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re running me down.
Keep off, I say, or I&rsquo;ll blow your stupid head off your
shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Harvey, with a sudden turn of the
tiller, threw the <i>Surprise</i> full tilt at the oncoming sloop.
There was a sharp crash of splintering wood, the
tearing of head-sails, and a shock that shook the
yachts from keel to topmast, as the <i>Surprise</i> rammed
the big black sloop just by the foremast stays, snapping
her own bowsprit short off and making an ugly
hole in her own planking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_358">[358]</div>
<p>Leaping just as the boats crashed, and holding a
coil of rope on his arm, Joe Hinman landed on the
top of the big sloop&rsquo;s cabin in the very midst of the
confusion. A moment more and he had made a few
quick turns about the mast, lashing the two yachts fast
together at the moment when Harvey, followed by
the rest of his crew, who came swarming out of the
cabin, sprang aboard the strange sloop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot the first boy that steps a foot on this
boat,&rdquo; cried the man; but the words were scarce out
of his mouth before they were upon him. He had
been in danger before and knew how to make the most
of his chances, and he stood, desperate but cool, as they
made their rush.</p>
<p>There was a shot, and Jack Harvey, who was leading,
gave a cry of pain, for a bullet just grazed his
left shoulder. He stumbled and fell full at the feet
of the man as another shot was fired and young Tim
thought his right hand was gone.</p>
<p>The next moment Harvey had the man by the legs,
while Allan Harding and George Baker and Joe made
a rush for him. The man fell heavily, Joe Hinman
clinging with both hands to one wrist, so that he
could not fire again. They rolled over and over in
the cockpit for a moment, the boys and he. Twice the
man got to his knees and twice they dragged him down
again; till, at length, young Tim, whose hand was
not shot away, but only slightly wounded, managed to
run in and deal the man a blow with the end of an
oar, which stunned him for a moment, so that they
got him flat and had bound the loose end of a halyard
about him before he came fully to his senses. Then,
as they proceeded to complete the job and tie him fast,
hand and foot, he recognized Harvey for the first
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_359">[359]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, where have I
seen you before? You&rsquo;re not the chap in the pasture,
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the game&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; said the man, coolly.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a mistake, and I knew it the moment after
I had done it. I was a fool to hit you that night. It&rsquo;s
my temper, that&rsquo;s what has beat me. It gets away
from me sometimes. I dare say if I had gone along
about my business you wouldn&rsquo;t have followed me,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; answered Harvey. &ldquo;That is why
I am glad you knocked me down,&rdquo; and then, taking a
quick glance over the side of the boat, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe! Allan! George! Out with the sweeps,
lively! We&rsquo;re going aground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey sprang to the wheel, hauling in on the main-sheet
as he did so.</p>
<p>But it was too late. There was a gentle shock that
shook the sloop from end to end, a dull, grating sound,
and the next moment the big sloop rested firmly on
a jagged rock of the reach, listing as she hung, and
wrenching the bilge so that she made water rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; cried Harvey. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a mess. We&rsquo;re
wrecked, and badly, too. How in the world are we
ever going to get out of this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_360">[360]</div>
<p>It was, indeed, a serious problem. The <i>Surprise</i>,
her bow planks ripped open by the collision, had sunk
within a few minutes, and now lay on bottom, with
her deck covered. The big sloop, hard aground and
full of iron ballast, was not a thing to be moved
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a scrape and no mistake,&rdquo; said Harvey.
&ldquo;Here we are, where a boat may pick us up in a day
or a week, but more likely not for a week. We&rsquo;ve
got our man, but the reefs have got us. Well, we
have got to figure out some way to get out of it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But first they took account of their wounds, which
had, now that the excitement was over, begun to
sting and smart. They found that neither Harvey&rsquo;s
nor Tim&rsquo;s wound was at all serious, mere surface
flesh-wounds. The back of young Tim&rsquo;s hand was
bare of skin for the length of three inches across, and
Harvey&rsquo;s shoulder bled badly till it was cleansed and
bandaged, but it was the price of victory, and they
accounted it cheap. All of them had honourable scars
of battle, bruises and scratches without number, and
every one of them was proud of his, and wouldn&rsquo;t
have had one less for the world.</p>
<p>Taking their prisoner, securely bound, they all rowed
ashore to survey their surroundings, build a fire and
get breakfast, and make plans for getting away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_361">[361]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to be done,&rdquo; said Harvey,
after they had finished breakfast and sat by the shore,
surveying the wrecks of the yachts. &ldquo;The <i>Surprise</i>
is done for. We can&rsquo;t raise her. But the big sloop
is not so badly hurt but what we can repair her, if
we can only float her. The first thing we have got
to do, when the tide goes out, is to get all that pig
iron out of her, and that&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s job, at the least.
Then we may beach her at high tide and patch her up.
It&rsquo;s a big contract, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day they brought the spare sails of the sloop
ashore and pitched a tent with them; and, when the
tide was low enough for them to work, they began
the hard labour of lightening the big sloop of its
ballast.</p>
<p>They worked all that tide like beavers, and by night
the yacht was light. They camped on shore that night,
standing watch by turns over their prisoner.</p>
<p>The next day at low water they found the worst
of the leaks in the sloop, and made shift to patch them
up temporarily with strips of canvas tacked on and
daubed with paint, which they found in the sloop&rsquo;s
locker, and by recaulking some of the seams with
oakum. By the next high tide, with hard pumping,
she was sufficiently lightened to float clear of the reef,
though still leaking badly, and they got her around
to a clear, steeply shelving strip of beach, where they
rested her more easily when the tide fell, and so could
work on the repairs to better advantage.</p>
<p>Another night in camp ashore, and the next day
they floated the sloop off again at high tide and loaded
about half of her ballast in again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_362">[362]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will keep her right side up till we can get
back to Southport,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;I think we can
make it, if we carry short sail, so as not to strain
her and open up those places where we have patched
her. We will try it, anyway, for I have half an idea
that our running off so soon after the fire may have
made talk about us, and the quicker we get back and
put an end to that the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that afternoon they began their voyage home
again, looking very serious as the mast of the yacht
<i>Surprise</i>, sticking out of water, faded from their
view, but swelling with pride and satisfaction as they
peered in now and then at a form that lay secure on
one of the cabin bunks.</p>
<p>They sailed all that night, for the breeze held fair
and light, and by daybreak of the following morning
they came into the harbour of Southport.</p>
<p>Harvey and Joe Hinman rowed ashore, soon after
they came to their old moorings off the camp, to see
how the land lay; but came back on the run in about
twenty minutes, and made the water boil as they rowed
out to the yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off for Mayville,&rdquo; cried Harvey. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
put on more sail, too, if it pulls the bottom out of her.
Why, what do you think! Who&rsquo;s arrested for the
fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he told the news, to the amazement of young
Tim and George Baker and Allan Harding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a score to pay to Tom Harris and Bob
White,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they saved your life, Jack,&rdquo; said young
Tim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;I owe them one
for that. Here&rsquo;s a chance to get square, if we can
only make it in time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_363">[363]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And only to think,&rdquo; muttered the man in the cabin,
as he looked out at the stalwart but boyish figure at
the wheel, &ldquo;that I had that young fellow in the same
boat with me at night in the middle of Samoset Bay!
Well, if I had only done as I set out to, then, I wouldn&rsquo;t
be here now, that&rsquo;s all. But how is a man to look
ahead so far?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_364">[364]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THE TRIAL</span></h2>
<p>What one man knew in Mayville was every
man&rsquo;s property. Gossip always spread
through the town like wildfire. So it happened
that on the morning of the arrival of the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> and the <i>Spray</i> there was a buzzing and a shaking
of heads and a wagging of tongues; and before long
the whole town knew that something of vast importance
was about to take place up at Squire Ellis&rsquo;s
court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those young fellows that set the hotel afire
over across at Southport,&rdquo; said a certain tall, gaunt
individual, who happened to be the centre of an excited
group on one of the street corners, near the town
pump. &ldquo;I hear as how Squire Barker is going to
defend them, but they do say he&rsquo;s got no case, because
I heard Lem Stevens say as he heard Squire Brackett
declare he saw them young chaps down in the billiard-room
of the hotel along about midnight, and the fire
started pretty quick after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, guess they&rsquo;ll catch it if Squire Brackett is
on their trail,&rdquo; volunteered another of the group. &ldquo;He
ain&rsquo;t given to showing kindness to anybody, much less
to a lot of firebugs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_365">[365]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they ever done it, anyway,&rdquo; ventured
a third. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem like that kind, from
all I can learn, and they do say as how they pitched
in and saved a lot of Colonel Witham&rsquo;s boarders from
being burned in their beds, when the flames was
a-spreadin&rsquo; fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the gossip waged, this way and that, while
impatient knots of idlers hung around the entrance to
Squire Ellis&rsquo;s court, waiting for ten o&rsquo;clock, when proceedings
should begin.</p>
<p>Shortly before the old town clock beat out the ten
solemn strokes that proclaimed the formal sitting of
justice, a whisper ran along the line of loiterers,
&ldquo;Here he comes. It&rsquo;s the judge.&rdquo; And that person
of great importance, a short, thick-set man, with a
quick, nervous step, an energetic, sharp manner, but,
withal, a kindly eye, entered the court-room. The next
moment the clock announced his punctuality.</p>
<p>The crowd swarmed into the court-room, stuffy and
hot enough already, and the air vibrated with expectancy.</p>
<p>Proceeding up the long village street at this moment
was a little group, headed by Captain Sam, not wholly
unimpressed with the importance of his own part in
the affair, the boys and Mrs. Warren following, and,
not far in the rear, the colonel and the squire. Just as
they reached the court-room door, Captain Sam halted
the little party for a moment, and, not without reluctance,
said: &ldquo;Well, boys, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to serve
these &rsquo;ere warrants before we go inside. I&rsquo;m free to
say I&rsquo;m sorry to do it, but they&rsquo;re the orders of this
&rsquo;ere honourable court, and they must be obeyed by
me, a sworn officer of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_366">[366]</div>
<p>And having disposed of this somewhat painful
formality, Captain Sam opened the door and the party
were in court.</p>
<p>Presently they were joined by Squire Barker, a
sober, elderly, clerical-looking lawyer, dressed in a
somewhat rusty suit of black, serious-minded, whose
lugubrious manner was not calculated to infuse a spirit
of cheer into hearts that were sinking.</p>
<p>The county attorney, who was to conduct the case
for the people of the State, a youthful attorney, of
comparatively recent admission to practice, bustled
about as became a functionary with the burden of an
important matter upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>The court-room, save for the buzzing of innumerable
flies upon the uncleaned window-panes, was still
as a church when His Honour announced that the
court was now open for whatsoever matters the county
attorney had to bring before it.</p>
<p>After the usual formality of acquainting His Honour
officially of the matter in hand, which matter His
Honour was already as much acquainted with as a
thousand and one busy tongues of gossip could make
him, the likewise formal answer of &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; was
returned, and, without further delay, Colonel Witham
was called to the stand.</p>
<p>The colonel, fully awake to his opportunity, took
the stand rather pompously, thrust a well-filled, expansive
waistband to the front, whence there dangled
from a waistcoat pocket a ponderous gold chain, plentifully
adorned with trinkets, in the handling of which,
as he testified, a large seal ring on a finger of his
right hand was ostentatiously displayed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_367">[367]</div>
<p>Yes,&mdash;in answer to questions,&mdash;he was the lessee
of the Bayview Hotel on the 10th of September last,
on which day it was burned to the ground; and, if he
did say it, there was no better conducted hotel along
the shores of Samoset Bay.</p>
<p>Suggestion by His Honour that he please answer the
questions as put, and reserve his own personal opinions
and convictions to himself, received by the colonel
with evident surprise and some little loss of dignity.</p>
<p>Then the colonel detailed, so far as he knew them,
the events of the night of the fire; how he was first
aroused by the cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; and how the first
persons he encountered&mdash;within his very hotel, in
fact&mdash;were the accused; how the smoke was even
then pouring up from the basement windows, and that
upon investigation he had found the whole basement
floor to be on fire, so that it was already far beyond
control.</p>
<p>Then there followed a detailed account of the fire,
of the destruction of this section and that, and, finally,
the utter collapse and ruin of the entire structure,
with all that it had contained. The colonel did the
scene full justice in his description, making an unmistakable
impression on the minds of the assembled
townsfolk.</p>
<p>Asked if he had seen any suspicious characters in
or about the hotel on the day or night of the fire, the
colonel said he had not; nor had any stranger who
had not been subsequently accounted for come ashore
from the steamers on that day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_368">[368]</div>
<p>Leaving at length the subject of the fire, County
Attorney Perkins came down to the subject of the
attempt to serve the warrants upon the boys at the
camp and at the Warren cottage, the failure, the subsequent
pursuit of the boys down the bay in the <i>Nancy
Jane</i>, and the final surrender of the yacht <i>Spray</i> in the
middle of the bay.</p>
<p>It was clear that this part of the evidence would
have great weight with the court. After the attorney&rsquo;s
questions he put several of his own, regarding the
escape from Little Reach, and whether it must have
been clear to the boys in the yacht that they were being
pursued.</p>
<p>It was this testimony that made Mr. Warren breathe
hardest, and put his hand to his head with a troubled
look.</p>
<p>Squire Barker&rsquo;s cross-examination was brief, but
he made two telling points, which might have their
influence. One was, that the boys had been very brave
on the night of the fire, and had undoubtedly saved
many lives. This the colonel reluctantly had to admit.
The other, and far more important point, was the
bringing out that early on the morning of the fire
the colonel had seen that the yacht <i>Surprise</i> was absent
from her moorings, whereas the colonel had seen her
lying there the afternoon preceding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it not common talk in the village that Harvey
and his crew were missing the very morning after the
fire?&rdquo; inquired Squire Barker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; answered the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you not see all of the accused about the
village for the entire day following the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_369">[369]</div>
<p>There was a buzz in the court-room, which indicated
that this point had told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it not true,&rdquo; continued Squire Barker,
&ldquo;that this Jack Harvey and his crew have not yet
returned, are still missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel said he believed such was the case.</p>
<p>Asked why he had not secured their arrest, he responded
that he felt sure he was on the right track,
as he would prove by his witness, Squire Brackett.</p>
<p>And Squire Brackett, nothing loath, was the next
witness. Having brought out, what everybody knew,
that the squire was a property owner and a man of
importance in his own village, the county attorney
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where were you shortly after midnight on
the night of September 10th?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was passing the Hotel Bayview on my way to
the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see as you neared the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a light in the billiard-room window, and
went to the window and looked in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see any one in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These accused,&rdquo; and the squire named in turn
each of the six boys and pointed them out in court.</p>
<p>They, feeling the eyes of all turned toward them,
the awful stillness of the court-room for the moment
following the squire&rsquo;s declaration, and oppressed more
than ever by the hot, choking atmosphere of the stuffy
little court, turned white and red by turns, wished
that the floor would open beneath their feet and swallow
them, and felt a burning sensation in their throats
as though they were stifling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_370">[370]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how soon did you see flames coming up
from the location of the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not say exactly; it might have been half
an hour. I was out in the bay in my sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you seen any suspicious characters in the
village on that day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the squire also recounted the events of the
pursuit of the yacht <i>Spray</i>, the escape through Little
Reach, and the subsequent surrender of the boys.</p>
<p>From Squire Barker it was brought out, as in the
testimony of the colonel, the fact that after Harvey
and his crew in the yacht <i>Surprise</i> had suddenly set
sail on the very morning of the fire, they had not been
seen nor heard of since. This, the squire admitted,
was common knowledge throughout the village.</p>
<p>Then there came to the stand Captain Sam, standing
awkwardly, with a hard clutch on the rail in
front of him, as if he were afraid of the court-house
suddenly dipping and rolling on a breaker and spilling
him overboard.</p>
<p>No, he had no objection to removing his tobacco
in deference to the Court, and did so; but forgot
that august presence before he had been testifying
long, and took another and a bigger chew.</p>
<p>Did he know the accused?</p>
<p>Reckoned he did, with a haw-haw that shook the
court-room.</p>
<p>Had he pursued them in his sloop the <i>Nancy Jane</i>,
in an endeavour to serve the warrants?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_371">[371]</div>
<p>He had, and they worked their boat like sailors, if
he did say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were you assisted in your pursuit by Colonel
Witham and Squire Brackett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assisted!&rdquo; drawled Captain Sam, and grinning
from ear to ear. &ldquo;Well, I dunno how much assisting
you&rsquo;d be pleased to call it, being as they were sick
as a boy that had eaten a peck of green apples, and
was sprawling around in the bottom of the boat like
a couple of halibut just catched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which, being pronounced by Captain Sam with
the utmost gravity, produced such a decided impression
on the audience of fisher-people and sailor-folk,
that there was a roar throughout the court-room, at
which His Honour announced that any such further
interruption would be followed by the clearing of the
room.</p>
<p>The squire and the colonel turned red in the face
and looked rather foolish, inwardly wishing that Captain
Sam was at the bottom of the bay.</p>
<p>Captain Sam, under further questioning, told again
the story of that afternoon&rsquo;s sailing, mentioning casually
that the colonel had requested to be set ashore
when the <i>Nancy Jane</i> was out in the middle of the
bay, which request, as Captain Sam explained, there
being no land near by excepting that straight down
under water, he was unable to grant.</p>
<p>Another titter through the court-room, the colonel
and the squire blushing redder than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_372">[372]</div>
<p>It was embarrassing enough to Captain Sam to
tell how he had put the <i>Nancy Jane</i> aground in Little
Reach, for he knew there was scarce a man or boy
within the sound of his voice who wouldn&rsquo;t vow to
himself that, if he had been in Captain Sam&rsquo;s place,
he would have known better. It was really mortifying.</p>
<p>Squire Barker made the most of this, not because
it could help his clients, but because it served in its
way to put one of the people&rsquo;s witnesses in a ridiculous
light, and because it gave him a chance to show
how smart a cross-examiner he could be, thereby
elevating himself in the eyes and admiration of his
townsfolk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you got aground where these young men took
their boat through all right, did you?&rdquo; queried Squire
Barker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got aground,&rdquo; snapped Captain Sam, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these young men took their boat through
safe and sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; roared Captain Sam. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you saw them just a few minutes before that,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you got to the entrance they were nowhere
in sight, and therefore must have sailed
through; they couldn&rsquo;t have dragged the <i>Spray</i> over
the rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel and the squire were rather enjoying
this, and had plucked up spirits enough to titter with
the rest at the discomfiture of Captain Sam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_373">[373]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you tried to imitate these young men and
go through as they did, but you didn&rsquo;t seem to know
the channel, and so got aground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Channel!&rdquo; roared Captain Sam, bellowing out
the word in a rage and shaking a fist at the squire.
&ldquo;Channel, did you say? Haven&rsquo;t I told you there
wasn&rsquo;t enough channel there to wash a sheep in?
Didn&rsquo;t I tell these two thick-headed numskulls&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
to the colonel and the squire&mdash;&ldquo;that we&rsquo;d
get aground if we went in there? And didn&rsquo;t they
snarl at me like two old women, and accuse me of
letting them &rsquo;ere boys get away? Didn&rsquo;t I know we&rsquo;d
get aground in there, and didn&rsquo;t these two seasick
old pussy-cats make me go ahead and do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Sam, beside himself with indignation,
roared this out so his voice could be heard far out
in the street. In vain the court rapped for order.
The whole court-room was convulsed, and, finally,
His Honour, overcome with the situation, leaned back
in his chair and laughed too.</p>
<p>Only the colonel and the squire, the butt of all the
merriment, looked alternately at the floor and the
ceiling, and mopped their faces with handkerchiefs
as red as their cheeks.</p>
<p>At length, when order was restored, Judge Ellis
said: &ldquo;Captain Sam, you are excused. You are in
contempt of court. The case will proceed without
testimony from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which Captain Sam, feeling that he had in a
measure vindicated his name and reputation, got down
from the stand in a somewhat better frame of mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">[374]</div>
<p>There followed several of the hotel guests, who
had been duly summonsed to tell what they knew
of the early stages of the fire, and whether they had
seen any suspicious characters about the hotel or the
village on that day. They made it very clear, together
with the testimony of some of the villagers,
that there had been no strange person seen in the town
either on that day or the preceding or the following
day, all of which argued, of course, that, if the fire
was set, it was set by some one in the town, who
was more or less known to every one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was definitely established by
Squire Barker that Harvey and his crew had set sail
in the <i>Surprise</i> while the hotel was still blazing furiously,
for there were two of the villagers who lived
down the island several miles from the hotel who
testified to seeing the <i>Surprise</i> beating down alongshore
about daylight.</p>
<p>This was highly important, and yet the one essential
thing was lacking, nor could it be supplied by
any evidence at hand, that Harvey or any one of his
crew had been seen about the hotel that night.</p>
<p>It was noon now, and time for recess. So His
Honour announced an adjournment to half-past two
that afternoon, and the crowd swarmed out-of-doors,
leaving the flies in undisputed possession of the unclean
windows.</p>
<p>It was hard for the boys to realize that at last they
were under restraint; that they were not free to
follow the crowd of villagers and their friends. The
seriousness of the situation assumed an even more
depressing aspect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_375">[375]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he will hold them?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Warren, anxiously, of Squire Barker, as the little
party, under the nominal charge of Captain Sam, sat
in the anteroom of the court-house, trying to partake
of a luncheon which had been provided, but for which
nobody seemed to have any appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; answered the squire, wisely.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a little afraid of it. I&rsquo;m just a little afraid.
You see, their getting into the hotel and being there
just before the fire can&rsquo;t be denied. And I suppose
that His Honour will hold that it was really breaking
and entering to get into the hotel in the night-time
in the way they did. And then, even though it may
have been accidental, the setting the fire, still, as it
followed and grew out of their unlawful act, they
can be held for setting the hotel on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentence, somewhat involved as it was, but
delivered with sageness and an ominous shake of the
head, set the boys to breathing hard, and more than
one of them found himself swallowing a lump in his
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t the slightest evidence that we set
the fire,&rdquo; said young Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the squire; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s what they
call circumstantial evidence, and that is, the fact of
your being in there just before it was discovered. It
may not be enough to convict on, but the question
that&rsquo;s bothering now is, will it be enough to hold
you over on, and I&rsquo;m bound to say it does look just
a little bad. However, we won&rsquo;t give up. We&rsquo;ll
fight it out to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just what there was to fight it out on, not one
of them could for the life of him suggest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_376">[376]</div>
<p>The minutes, which seemed like hours, dragged
wearily on, and the air in the stuffy little court-house
seemed to grow denser and more unendurably stifling.
One o&rsquo;clock. Two o&rsquo;clock. The hum of returning
villagers became more loud. The hour for the resumption
of the session was only thirty minutes away.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was the sound of light, quick,
nervous footsteps along the hallway, the door was
pushed open, and in there bounced a little old lady,
whose thin face beamed and flushed with excitement
under a bonnet, fashionably but rather youthfully
trimmed with bright flowers, dressed in a gown
quaintly cut, but giving evidence of the means of the
wearer, and bearing on one arm a small basket and
in the other hand a chatelaine-bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mrs. Newcome!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Warren,
jumping up excitedly, and glad even of this
interruption. &ldquo;What can have brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a wicked shame!&rdquo; cried the little old
lady, paying no attention to Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s question.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the cruellest thing I ever heard of, bringing
these boys here. I&rsquo;ll tell the judge that, too, if they&rsquo;ll
let me. Where is that old scamp, Colonel Witham,
and that old mischief-maker, Squire Brackett? If
I don&rsquo;t give them a piece of my mind! I told Jerry
about it all the way over, and you ought to have
heard him growl. Here he is; just listen how angry
he is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_377">[377]</div>
<p>And Mrs. Newcome, unfastening the cover of the
basket which she had been carrying, disclosed to view
the aforesaid Jerry, lying within on a cushion. The
cat, in corroboration of his mistress&rsquo;s declaration,
certainly did growl and snarl and then yowl dolorously;
but whether as an endorsement of old Mrs.
Newcome&rsquo;s indignation, or whether giving vent to
his own at being whisked about in a basket on a
boiling hot day, no one but he could say positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boys didn&rsquo;t set that fire,&rdquo; snapped the old
lady, decisively; &ldquo;and I just want to do what I can
for them. I couldn&rsquo;t leave Jerry behind. He gets so
lonesome without me. So I brought him along. And
now, Mr. Warren, I suppose you know I&rsquo;m not the
poorest person that comes down here to spend summers,
and I&rsquo;ve got some property around these parts,
too&mdash;some land in this very town. And if there&rsquo;s
any what-do-you-call-it to pay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any bail?&rdquo; suggested the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;bail. That&rsquo;s the word. If there&rsquo;s
any of that to pay, I&rsquo;ve got the securities right here,&rdquo;
and Mrs. Newcome shook the chatelaine-bag vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Mr. Warren, amused
in spite of himself. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m hoping we shall not
have need of bail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the midst of it there came the ringing voice
of the crier in the court-room adjoining, and the little
party all filed into court again, old Mrs. Newcome
bringing up the rear, with the basket on her arm,
whence there emerged now and then a stifled wail,
in spite of her whispered admonitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have closed our case,&rdquo; said the prosecuting
attorney. And the defence was begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Warren!&rdquo; called Squire Barker, and
George, paling slightly at the ordeal, but doing his
best to keep up a stout heart, took the stand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_378">[378]</div>
<p>He told his story with a frankness that was convincing,
keeping nothing back; and at the close
Squire Barker asked: &ldquo;And did you, or did you see
anybody else set a fire that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered. And there was no
doubt that he had made a good impression.</p>
<p>But there were certain ugly facts that were made
to stick out more embarrassingly on the prosecuting
attorney&rsquo;s cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will admit,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you left on the
second day following the fire, because you did not
care to be questioned about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because we knew that our being in the hotel
that night would look suspicious, if it were known,&rdquo;
answered George Warren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you were going to conceal that fact, if you
could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think we were&mdash;for awhile, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you ran away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t start out with the idea of running
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did run from the <i>Nancy Jane</i> when you
found she was following and pursuing you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;I
realize now it was a foolish thing to do. But it was
not because we were guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were all in the basement of the hotel
a few moments before the fire started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_379">[379]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said the prosecuting attorney, and
George left the stand.</p>
<p>Henry Burns, called next, did the best he could for
his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s fault, it&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
see, it was my suggestion that got us in there. I
was the first to go inside, and the others came only
after I had urged them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Squire Barker knew that this avowal, honest
as it was, could not help them in the eyes of the law.
So, having asked a few perfunctory questions, he
turned the witness over to the prosecuting attorney.
The latter brought out about the same points that he
had made in the testimony of George Warren, and
that was all.</p>
<p>It was quite clear that Squire Barker was only calling
the boys from a sense of duty to them, to let them
make the best impression they might upon the mind
of the judge. It was the only suit he had to play.</p>
<p>Then followed Arthur and Joe, and at length Tom
and Bob.</p>
<p>The squire was at the end of his resources now, as
far as evidence could go. It remained but for him
to do his duty in the minds of his clients and his
townsmen, and he did it&mdash;to his own satisfaction,
at least, in his address to the court. He painted the
heroism of the boys at the fire in colours glowing as
the flames. He enlarged upon the probability and the
presumption of innocence. And he paid his respects
to the colonel and the squire in a few stinging sentences
that turned the eyes of the assembled audience
upon them in indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_380">[380]</div>
<p>And when he was all done and the court-room
turned with expectancy toward the prosecuting attorney,
the latter simply said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour, the people will submit their case
without argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, with startling abruptness, the case had
come to its crisis. There was nothing left but for
the law to act.</p>
<p>There succeeded a deathlike stillness in the court-room.
His Honour sat for some moments, with his
eyes cast down upon his desk. He seemed loath to
speak. Finally he arose and, with some effort, said,
gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all my experience as attorney and as judge I
have never before been placed in a position so distasteful
to me nor so distressing. The case of these
young men is most unfortunate. Their stories impress
me as honestly told. Their characters are clearly
such as are opposed to any such wanton destruction
as is here alleged. And yet the circumstances are
such that I should be blind to the duty of my office
if I failed to hold them for trial. I hope that when
their case shall come to trial this fall that they will
have gathered evidence that shall show conclusively
their innocence. In the meantime, deeply as I regret
it, it becomes my painful duty to order that they be
held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again an utter stillness in the court-room, broken
only by the sobbing of a woman. The entire court-room
waited silently for the next move, amazed at
the suddenness of the conclusion. Six boys set their
teeth hard and tried to look undismayed, but the face
of each spoke only too plainly of his distress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_381">[381]</div>
<p>Then all at once the patter of feet broke the silence
in the court-room, and a slight boyish figure, poorly
dressed and unkempt, darted up the aisle, into the
august presence of the court, and sought refuge in
the seat next to that occupied by Mr. Warren.</p>
<p>A court officer, who had been stationed at the door,
lumbered in after the boyish figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officer,&rdquo; cried Squire Ellis, irritably, &ldquo;how came
you to let this lad into the court-room? What does
this mean? Put him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Your Honour,&rdquo; said the officer,
very red in the face, &ldquo;I drove him away from the
door once, but he dodged in past me again before
I could stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove him from the room at once,&rdquo; said the
court, sharply.</p>
<p>The officer advanced.</p>
<p>But Tim Reardon&mdash;for it was he&mdash;had in the
meantime seized upon Mr. Warren, and, though
labouring under an excitement so intense as almost
to deprive him wholly of the power of speech, communicated
something to him of the greatest importance.
Mr. Warren, in turn, having repeated this
communication to Squire Barker, the latter hastily
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;this young man
brings evidence of the most startling character, and
which will, I am sure, reverse Your Honour&rsquo;s decision.
He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_382">[382]</div>
<p>But here a sound from the street outside was borne
in upon the court-room, which caused the squire to
pause for a moment, while he and every person in
the room listened in amazement.</p>
<p>The noise outside increased, and now there came
the sound of many voices, men and women and boys
and girls shouting out some piece of news, and then
a loud cheering. The tumult rapidly grew, until it
seemed as if all in a moment the entire village was
marching upon the court-house.</p>
<p>Despite the loud rapping for order of the court
officers and the sharp order of the court for silence,
many in the court-room rushed to the windows and
looked out. A strange sight met their eyes. A procession
was coming up the street, in the midst of
which, his hands bound behind his back, a man was
walking, while, grasping him by either arm as they
walked beside him, were Jack Harvey and Joe Hinman.</p>
<p>Into the court-room the procession burst like an
avalanche. The room had seemed somewhat crowded
before, but now at least fifty or sixty more men
wedged themselves in, with Harvey and his crew and
the strange man still in the centre of them. The rest
of the crowd that followed, not being able to force
themselves into the court-room, seated themselves on
the stairs just outside, and formed a long line out
into the street.</p>
<p>His Honour, powerless to stay this astonishing inrush
of the townspeople, waited till the crowd had
resolved itself into something like order, and then,
rapping for silence, demanded to know the cause of
this invasion of and assault upon the dignity of the
court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_383">[383]</div>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence and delay, and then
a broad-shouldered youth pushed his way through the
crowd and walked toward the witness-stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried His Honour. &ldquo;Officer, stop that
young man. Let the business of this court proceed
in its regular order. Mr. Barker, does the court understand
that you ask to have the case reopened on
the ground of newly discovered evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Honour,&rdquo; replied the squire, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this young man, do you wish to make him
your witness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Your Honour,&rdquo; answered Squire Barker.
&ldquo;Although I am not certain as to just what he has
to testify to, I wish to have him made our witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;State your name to the court,&rdquo; said Squire Barker,
as the youth ascended the witness-stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Harvey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And am I correctly informed that you have important
testimony to give before this court in this
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the man that set the fire,&rdquo; replied Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you produce him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here in this room,&rdquo; answered Harvey.</p>
<p>And at this moment the crowd parted and allowed
to pass a man who walked doggedly forward, with
eyes downcast, hands firmly bound behind his back,
while with him walked the remaining members of
Harvey&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the man whom you say set the fire?&rdquo;
queried Squire Barker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_384">[384]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know he set the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s confessed it, because he knew there was no
way out of it for him. Haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; demanded
Harvey, turning to the man.</p>
<p>The other nodded his head sullenly.</p>
<p>The uproar that greeted this acknowledgment was
deafening. It was several moments before order
could be restored in the court-room, and then the
news borne rapidly to those outside gave rise to a
second tumult, which again stopped the proceedings
of the court.</p>
<p>Then, when order had been finally restored, Harvey
narrated the extraordinary events that had followed
the meeting of the man in the pasture, down to
his capture and confession; a confession that included
the admission that he was none other than the
man Chambers, and that he had set fire to the hotel
for revenge.</p>
<p>There never was anything like the scene that followed
in all the history of court procedure in the
county from time out of mind. It did not take the
court long, however, to declare that the youthful
prisoners, whom he had felt it his solemn duty to
hold for trial, were honourably cleared, and were
free to go at liberty. It did not take long, considering
the fact that the prisoner pleaded guilty, to hold
him for trial. Nor did it take long for good-hearted
Judge Ellis to descend from the bench and shake
hands with the boys, each and every one of them, and
congratulate them upon their complete exoneration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_385">[385]</div>
<p>Once outside the court-room, however, what a
storm and tumult of congratulation awaited them.
The first thing they knew there was a rush for them,
and up on the shoulders of a crowd of excited fishermen
they went, and were borne along, amid cheering.
And Harvey, too, though he struggled against it, was
borne aloft, while the news of his brave capture of
the man Chambers was shouted out to all in the
town.</p>
<p>In the midst of it all two figures were espied, slinking
along toward the boat-landing, anxious to escape
notice. A din of yells and catcalls and hisses told
them they were discovered, and the colonel and the
squire, sorry pictures of dismay and humiliation,
quickened their steps and made their escape, thankful
enough to escape unharmed from the indignant villagers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey,&rdquo; said George Warren, as he stood
grasping the other&rsquo;s hand about two hours later, as
the boys formed a little group on the deck of the
steamer that was heading for Southport, &ldquo;you have
more than evened the thing up. Tom and Bob saved
you from drowning; but you have saved us all from
disgrace, and I&rsquo;m not sure but what I&rsquo;d rather drown
than go through a disgraceful ordeal like this
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harvey, clasping the hand of the other
warmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still the one that&rsquo;s in debt. They
saved me from more than drowning. They saved
me from disgrace, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call it even, anyway,&rdquo; said Henry Burns,
&ldquo;and shake hands all around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">[386]</div>
<p>Some weeks later, as Henry Burns and George
Warren sat on the veranda of the Warren cottage,
looking out across the cove, a graceful yacht turned
the headland and came up into the harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks familiar,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;Where
have we seen her before? Why, it&rsquo;s the <i>Eagle</i>, or
the <i>Sprite</i>, or whatever her real name may be. I
wonder what she&rsquo;s doing here. She was seized by the
county and her owners advertised for. I wonder if
they can have been discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down and take a look at her,&rdquo; said
George Warren. &ldquo;She is the prettiest thing that ever
came into this harbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked down to the shore a boat put off
from the yacht and a man pulled in to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where I can find either Henry
Burns or Jack Harvey?&rdquo; he inquired, addressing the
two boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Harvey,&rdquo; answered Henry
Bums, &ldquo;but I can inform you about the other person.
What do you want of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a note for you, if you mean that you&rsquo;re
Henry Burns,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; said Henry Burns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first
note I&rsquo;ve got since I&rsquo;ve been here. I wonder who
can have written it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Burns deliberately tore open the envelope
and unfolded a letter. He glanced hastily at the contents,
stopped short, and gave a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; he said, solemnly, &ldquo;will you hit me
once, good and hard, so I can tell whether I am
dreaming or not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_387">[387]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think there&rsquo;s any need of that,&rdquo; answered
the other, laughing. &ldquo;You seem to be about
as wide-awake as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Henry Burns, &ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t hit me,
just read that letter to me aloud, anyway. Perhaps
I&rsquo;ll believe it if I hear you read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be addressed to you and Jack Harvey
both,&rdquo; said George Warren. &ldquo;Perhaps I need his
permission, too, to read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t. Go ahead,&rdquo; demanded Henry
Burns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_388">[388]</div>
<p>The letter read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Mayville.</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Henry Burns and Jack Harvey</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My dear Young Men:</i>&mdash;You have each of you
proved yourselves heroes in the events of the last few
weeks. To you, Henry Burns, I am indebted for
the rescue of my devoted Jerry, my pet and companion
of many years. To you and your companions,
I am, indeed, indebted for my own life. To you,
Jack Harvey, I am indebted for the saving from disgrace
of these young friends of mine. As you may
know, the yacht captured from the man Chambers
was condemned by the county officials, advertised,
and finally put up at auction and sold, her former
owner, if there ever was another besides Chambers,
not having claimed her. She was, I am informed, a
very expensive boat; but as there were few bidders
among the fishermen, I was enabled to bid off the
boat at a figure easily within my means. This letter
is to inform you that I have presented the yacht to
you, to be owned equally by you two. The papers
will be made out later and sent to your parents or
guardians. Hoping that you will enjoy many happy
days aboard her, I remain,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Sincerely yours,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Anna Newcome</span>.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S. Don&rsquo;t upset her and get drowned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, old fellow,&rdquo; cried George Warren. &ldquo;Let
me congratulate you. You are the two luckiest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Henry Burns was running as fast as his legs
could carry him in the direction of Harvey&rsquo;s camp.</p>
